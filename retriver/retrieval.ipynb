The prosecution rested but contended a charge of manslaughter should have been upheld because of a statute. The law forbade a person from pointing a loaded gun at or toward another person. When Frayne was discharged from the court, the decision to free the actor was given \"emphatic applause.\" Newspapers reported Frayne and Von Behren were engaged to be married.\\nThe remains of Annie Von Behren were sent on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Brooklyn on December 2.

He was evicted for intervening in a confrontation between OB\\'s Norwegian Bengt Sæternes and Randers\\' Ghanaian Issah Ahmed by stating that \"this is Denmark\", which the referee deemed \"indecent language\" towards Ahmed. Sørensen stated that he did not have any racistic intention but wanted to end the confrontation which he found an annoying pause in the game, and had finished the sentence \"and we clearly don\\'t speak the same language\". The explanation was accepted by the Danish Football Association, who did not impose any additional punishment except from the one-game suspension due to the red card.\\nWhen Laursen left OB in the winter 2007, Sørensen declined to become new team captain, settling as vice-captain to Esben Hansen.

Lee was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years for killing his sister-in-law in 1994, but despite DNA evidence and his confession to the other murders in 2019, he could not be prosecuted for them because the statute of limitations had expired.\\nEarly life.\\nBorn on 31 January 1963, Lee Chun-jae was said to be an individual who grew up well in his early years, and had a good education up till high school and worked well with others, according to his mother in 2019 when the 75-year-old was interviewed about her son\\'s crimes. Lee\\'s mother was reportedly devastated and shocked to hear that her son was involved in the unsolved Hwaseong murders. He had a younger brother who drowned in his childhood, which seemingly traumatised him.\\nAfter graduating from high school in February 1983, Lee joined the Republic of Korea Army and served as a tank pilot; he was discharged on January 23, 1986. He then worked for an electric parts company. In 1990, he began his job at a parent construction company in Cheongpa, Yongsan, where he became a crane driver without a license.

However, Lee was convicted and sentenced to death in May 1994, and his conviction was upheld in September of the same year.

The victims, all women, were found bound, gagged, raped, and in most cases strangled to death with their own clothes, such as pantyhose or socks. The murders sparked the largest criminal case in South Korea with over 2million man-days spent on investigation and over 21,000 suspects investigated. The cases remained unsolved for 30 years, until Lee himself was identified as a suspect in 2019 and Lee confessed to 4 undisclosed murders not attributed to the serial murders and all 10 serial murders, including the case previously determined to be a copycat crime for which a man named Yoon Seung-yeo was sentenced to life in prison.\\nThe serial murders are considered to be the most infamous in South Korea\\'s modern history. They are often compared to those committed by the Zodiac Killer in the United States, and served as the inspiration for the 2003 film \"Memories of Murder\".\\nBackground.\\nThe case began with the disappearance of Lee Wan-im (71) on September 15, 1986, while returning home after visiting her daughter. Her body was found in a pasture on September 19, 1986, at 14:00, four days following the murder. A month later on October 20, 1986, Park Hyun-sook (25) disappeared after getting off the bus while returning home from Songtan. Her body was found on October 23, 1986, at 14:50 in a canal. Two months later on December 12, 1986, Gwon Jung-bon (25) disappeared in front of her house. Her body was found three months later on April 23, 1987, at 14:00 in an embankment. Seven more murders followed over the next years.\\nThe last murder was estimated to have taken place around 21:00 on April 3, 1991. Gwon Soon-sang (69) was discovered dead, raped, and strangled with pantyhose on a hill.\\nInvestigation.\\nThe case is infamous within Korea for being the first truly identifiable string of murders with a similar modus operandi. Reportedly, more than 2million police officers, a record number for a single case, were mobilized to investigate the murders. Moreover, police officers involved spent 2million man-days on the case. The total number of suspects also grew to enormous numbers, eventually reaching a total count of 21,280 individuals. In addition, 40,116 individuals had their fingerprints taken, and 570 DNA samples and 180 hair samples were analyzed.\\nThe first five murders happened within a 6\\xa0km (3.7 mile) radius of Hwaseong, prompting police to spread out in teams of two, positioned every 100 meters (328 feet), but the next killing happened where there was no police presence. During the investigation, rumors that the killer targeted women wearing red clothes on rainy days spread, leading some female police officers to wear red clothes in an attempt to lure the killer into a trap.\\nA suspect sketch was drawn based on the memory of the bus driver, Kang, and bus conductor, Uhm, who saw a man get on the bus shortly after the seventh murder on September 7, 1988. The characteristics of the suspect, which were described by the bus driver, were similar to the descriptions given by survivors who were sexually assaulted. According to the victims, the culprit at the time of the incident was a thin-framed man in his mid-20s, with a height of 165 to 170 centimeters, short cut sporty-type hair, no double eyelids, and a sharp nose. In addition, he was described as having soft hands. Police also stated that the suspect had a \"B\" blood type, but in 2019, police acknowledged that this was likely inaccurate, because Lee has blood type \"O\". A survivor of the serial murders, 36-year-old Lee Geum-ran, was attacked by Lee sometime in late 1986 and she described him as skinny, with a low voice.\\nOn July 27, 1989, Yoon Sung-yeo, a 22-year-old man, was arrested for the murder of the eighth victim, 14-year-old Park Sang-hee. Yoon admitted guilt during questioning, and according to a 1989 report written by an expert at National Forensic Service, the forensic tests of pubic hair samples found at the scene suggested similarities with his, returning a 40% match with Yoon\\'s. This case was determined to be a copycat crime, and Yoon was sentenced to life in prison.\\nIn addition, in the tenth case, the genes obtained from a semen sample were different from the ninth case, and the location and method of crime were different from the other cases, suggesting a different culprit. Except for the first crime, which occurred around 06:00, the second to tenth murders occurred mainly between 19:00 and 23:00.\\nReports state that at least four individuals, deemed as possible suspects, took their own lives in the 1990s after being investigated and allegedly abused by police.\\nPublic reaction.\\nThe release of the film \"Memories of Murder\" in 2003, which was partially inspired by the serial murders, sparked renewed interest in the case. The murder of a female college student in Hwaseong in 2004 also sparked renewed interest and fears that a serial killer had returned. The serial murders made headlines again as the statute of limitations for the most recent victims was due to expire on April 2, 2006. At the time of the killings, there was a 15-year statute of limitations for first-degree murder. This was increased to 25 years in 2007, and finally lifted in 2015, but it was not retroactive. However, evidence and police records were kept due to the significance of the case.\\nIdentification and confession.\\nOn September 18, 2019, police announced that Lee had been identified as a suspect in the serial murders. He was identified after DNA from the underwear of one of the victims was matched with his, and subsequent DNA testing linked him to four of the other unsolved serial murders. At the time he was identified, he was already serving a life sentence at a prison in Busan for the rape and murder of his sister-in-law. Lee initially denied any involvement in the serial murders, but on October 2, 2019, police announced that Lee had confessed to killing 14 people, including all 10 victims in the serial murders, which includes a case previously considered to be a copycat crime, and 4 others. Three of those other murders happened in Hwaseong but had not previously been attributed to the serial killer, and the other two happened in Cheongju. As of October 2019, details about those four victims have not been released. In addition to the murders, he also confessed to more than 30 rapes and attempted rapes.\\nOn November 15, 2019, police announced that they had reached a provisional conclusion that Lee was responsible for all 10 serial murders. Police expressed that Lee had a weak self-esteem due to his introverted personality but experienced a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance for the first time in his mandatory military service, which led him to commit sex crimes to express his frustration caused by his monotonous life following his discharge from the military. The provincial police chief stated that Lee displayed psychopathic tendencies by being unable to empathize with the victims\\' pain and suffering and continuously showing off his crimes.\\nOn July 2, 2020, the police confirmed that Lee committed 14 murders and nine rapes in relation to the Hwaseong serial murders with the motive of relieving his sexual desire, closing the case 33 years after the first victim\\'s death. On November 2, 2020, Lee appeared in court as a witness for the 8th murder re-trial, where he publicly confessed to committing 14 murders in relation to the Hwaseong serial murders and 30 sex crimes, which led to Yoon being acquitted. Lee remained in prison serving his life sentence. Lee also expressed that he had no intention to be granted parole and released, as he did not want to face the public condemnation for his crime like notorious child rapist Cho Doo-soon, whose release after serving his 12-year jail term led to public outrage and widespread protests.\\nWrongful conviction of Yoon Sung-yeo.\\nYoon was sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling at the time, alleging that police coerced him into giving false confessions through torture. His appeal was denied and he served 19.5 years in jail before being released on parole in 2009.\\nYoon filed for a re-trial of his case on November 13, 2019, following news reports that Lee had confessed to all 10 serial murders. Two days later, police announced that they had reached a provisional conclusion that Lee was responsible for the murder for which Yoon was convicted. Police said Lee\\'s confession in the eighth murder \\'elaborately and coherently\\' described both the scene and the victim. This raised concerns that police had charged an innocent man, with the district prosecutors\\' office confirming that Yoon underwent cruel treatment by investigators at the time of his arrest and that a forensic report by the National Forensic Service had been fraudulently written. In December 2019, the Gyeonggi South Provincial Police Agency booked and charged eight of the original investigators with abuse of power and illegal detention for allegedly physically abusing Yoon when he was a suspect, forcing him to make a false confession, and falsifying investigative documents.\\nThe court accepted Yoon\\'s plea for a re-trial in January 2020. The final court hearing was held on November 2, 2020, where Lee stood as a witness confessing to the murder and describing the crime scene. Yoon Sung-yeo was acquitted of murder on 17 December 2020, after the re-trial court accepted that Yoon was innocent all along and finding Lee guilty of Bak\\'s murder despite the expiration of the statute of limitations.\\nIn media.\\nSeveral films and television shows were based on the Hwaseong serial murders.\\nList of known victims.\\n\"The first 10 murders were part of the Hwaseong serial murders.\"'),\n ('8033169',\n  \"Ulmus parvifolia 'Ohio'\",\n  'The Chinese Elm cultivar Ulmus parvifolia \\'Ohio\\' was raised by A.

The determination that one has committed that violation is made by an external body (a \"court of law\") and is, therefore, as definitive as the record-keeping of the body. So the most basic definition is fundamentally circular: a person is guilty of violating a law, if a court says so.\\nPhilosophically, guilt in criminal law is a reflection of a functioning society and its ability to condemn individuals\\' actions. It rests fundamentally on a presumption of free will, in which individuals choose actions and are, therefore, subjected to external judgement of the rightness or wrongness of those actions. As described by Judge Alvin B. Rubin in \"United States v. Lyons\" (1984):\\nMoral and legal definitions.\\n\"Guilt\" is the obligation of a person who has violated a moral standard to bear the sanctions imposed by that moral standard. In legal terms, guilt means having been found to have violated a criminal law, though law also raises \\'the issue of defences, pleas, the mitigation of offences, and the defeasibility of claims\\'.\\nLes Parrott draws a three-fold distinction between \"\"objective\" or \"legal\" guilt, which occurs when society\\'s laws have been broken... \"social\" guilt...[over] an unwritten law of social expectation\", and finally the way \"\"personal\" guilt occurs when someone compromises one\\'s own standards\".\\nRemedies.\\nGuilt can sometimes be remedied by: punishment (a common action and advised or required in many legal and moral codes); forgiveness (as in transformative justice); making amends (see reparation or acts of reparation), or \"restitution\\xa0... an important step in finding freedom from real guilt\\'; or by sincere remorse (as with confession in Catholicism or restorative justice). Guilt can also be remedied through intellectualisation or cognition (the understanding that the source of the guilty feelings was illogical or irrelevant). Helping other people can also help relieve guilt feelings: \"thus guilty people are often helpful people\\xa0... helping, like receiving an external reward, seemed to get people feeling better\". There are also the so-called \"Don Juans of achievement\\xa0... who pay the installments due their superego not by suffering but by achievements... Since no achievement succeeds in really undoing the unconscious guilt, these persons are compelled to run from one achievement to another\".\\nLaw does not usually accept the agent\\'s self-punishment, but some ancient codes did: in Athens, the accused could propose their own remedy, which could, in fact, be a reward, while the accuser proposed another, and the jury chose something in-between. This forced the accused to effectively bet on his support in the community, as Socrates did when he proposed \"room and board in the town hall\" as his fate. He lost and drank hemlock, a poison, as advised by his accuser.'),\n ('8033212',\n  'James McCarthy (footballer)',\n  'James Patrick McCarthy (born 12 November 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Scottish Premiership club Celtic.

He is the youngest child of Willie and Marie McCarthy, and is a former student of St Margaret Mary\\'s Secondary School in Castlemilk. He grew up supporting Celtic, and tried out for their youth teams, but was turned down due to the large number of players the club had already taken on.\\nClub career.\\nHamilton Academical.\\nMcCarthy made his debut for Hamilton Academical against Queen of the South as a substitute on 30 September 2006, becoming the youngest player to play for Hamilton in the 21st century. His full debut came against Airdrie United on 11 November 2006, a day before his 16th birthday. On 6 January 2007, at 16 years and 55 days old, McCarthy became the youngest player ever to score in Hamilton Academical\\'s history when he scored in a Scottish Cup defeat against Livingston.\\nOn 17 May 2008, after a season which saw his club promoted to the Scottish Premier League, McCarthy signed a new three-year contract with the club. He won the SPFA Young Player of the Year award for the 2008–09 season.\\nWigan Athletic.\\nHamilton accepted a bid for McCarthy from Wigan Athletic on 16 July 2009. He completed the move to Wigan on 21 July, on a five-year deal, believed to be worth just under £1.2\\xa0million. The fee could rise to £3.0\\xa0million depending on appearances. McCarthy made his debut for Wigan on 22 August 2009, as a 74th-minute substitute in a 5–0 defeat to Manchester United. He scored his first goal for Wigan in the FA Cup third round victory against fellow Premier League team Hull City on 2 January 2010, and marked his first Premier League start with a goal in a 2–0 victory away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 16 January 2010. He was later joined in the Wigan midfield by former Hamilton teammate James McArthur.\\nAfter an impressive start to the 2010–11 season, he picked up a serious ankle injury against Bolton Wanderers on 23 October 2010, keeping him out of action for three months. He scored on his return to the line-up against Aston Villa on 25 January 2011. On 5 February 2011, McCarthy scored twice in a 4–3 victory against Blackburn Rovers. \\nIn August 2012, McCarthy signed a new five-year contract at the club. He was part of the Wigan Athletic team that overcame Manchester City in the 2013 FA Cup Final; afterwards he hailed manager Roberto Martínez as \"a tactical genius\".\\nEverton.\\nOn 2 September 2013, McCarthy rejoined former Wigan manager Roberto Martínez at Everton, signing a long term deal worth £13m to become the club\\'s second most expensive player in their history; due to a clause in his Wigan contract, his former club Hamilton received a sell-on fee from the Everton transfer, which they used to invest in the youth system through which the player had emerged. He forged a partnership with Gareth Barry which was a key factor in Everton amassing 72 points during the campaign, a club record in the Premier League. Martínez claimed that McCarthy\\'s performances had been so impressive that his transfer value had doubled during his first season. McCarthy had to wait until the last game of the season to score his first goal for the club when he netted the opener in a 2–0 win over Hull City.\\nOn 15 March 2015, McCarthy scored his first goal of the 2014–15 season in a 3–0 home win against Newcastle United.

Earlier that day, he had provided an assist to Romelu Lukaku, allowing Lukaku to score the fastest Everton Premier League goal of all time. McCarthy eventually missed the rest of season due to a hamstring injury he had sustained whilst on international duty in March 2017; Everton manager Ronald Koeman expressed his displeasure at Republic of Ireland manager Martin O\\'Neill selecting a half-fit McCarthy repeatedly, which had aggravated existing hamstring issues.\\nOn 20 January 2018, McCarthy suffered a broken leg (tibia and fibula) in an attempt to block a shot on goal by West Bromwich Albion\\'s Salomón Rondón, resulting in the striker accidentally kicking McCarthy\\'s lower leg causing it to fracture. Rondón was visibly upset by the incident and also became emotional when recalling it in an interview some months later. McCarthy was ruled out for the rest of the 2017–18 season, and only made one further senior appearance for Everton, coming off the bench for the last 15 minutes of a home league fixture against Manchester United in April 2019, at which point his team were already 4–0 ahead.\\nCrystal Palace.\\nOn 7 August 2019, Crystal Palace signed McCarthy from Everton for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute for Andros Townsend in an away 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United on 18 August. He received a yellow card for retaliation four minutes later.\\nCeltic.\\nOn 3 August 2021, McCarthy joined Scottish Premiership club Celtic on a four-year contract.\\nInternational career.\\nEarly years.\\nAt the age of sixteen, McCarthy accepted an invitation to play for the Republic of Ireland. He was eligible because his grandfather, Paddy Coyle, was born in The Rosses, County Donegal. However, McCarthy also stated that he would have played for Scotland if they had offered him an international call-up first. Despite multiple attempts to persuade McCarthy to switch his allegiance to the country of his birth, he reaffirmed his decision to play for the Republic of Ireland.\\nMcCarthy made his international debut for the Republic of Ireland Under-17s in January 2007 against Italy. He scored his first goal against Greece when winning his third cap in March of the same year. He was quickly promoted to the Under-18s and played his first game at that level versus Germany in November 2007. He scored twice in the return game that same month. McCarthy played one game for the Under-19s in September 2007 against Portugal. and was subsequently selected for a number of these squads in 2008. McCarthy came on as a half time substitute for the Republic of Ireland Under-21s in their European Championship qualifier on 31 March against Turkey. McCarthy made an instant impression, creating opportunities for the lone striker, as well as making many intelligent runs in behind the Turkish defence.\\nSenior team.\\nMcCarthy received his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland national squad in February 2010, for a friendly with Brazil played in London. He made his debut as a substitute, replacing Stoke City\\'s Liam Lawrence after 70 minutes. McCarthy withdrew from the Ireland squad for their 2011 Nations Cup match against Wales. This led to media speculation that McCarthy may switch his allegiance to Scotland, as his appearance in the friendly against Brazil did not tie him to Ireland under the present rules. The speculation was fuelled by Wigan manager Roberto Martínez who insisted that McCarthy was still considering his international future, even after McCarthy and Giovanni Trapattoni had a face to face meeting in which McCarthy reportedly confirmed his commitment to Ireland.\\nThe question of McCarthy\\'s international allegiance was finally resolved in March 2011 after he accepted a call-up for Ireland\\'s Euro 2012 qualification match against Macedonia, in which he came off the bench replacing Robbie Keane to earn his first competitive cap, rendering him ineligible to play for Scotland. On 4 May 2011, McCarthy was called into the Irish squad for the games against Northern Ireland and Scotland. He reportedly went \"AWOL\" after not showing up for training. Later Martínez, the Wigan manager, came out and said he will be out \"for at least four weeks\".\\nOn 7 May 2012, Giovanni Trapattoni confirmed that McCarthy had asked to be withdrawn from consideration for the Irish UEFA Euro 2012 squad following his father\\'s diagnosis with cancer.\\nMcCarthy played in nine of the ten matches in Ireland\\'s unsuccessful 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign picking up the man of the match awards against the Faroe Islands and Sweden.\\nHe was selected for the Ireland squad for UEFA Euro 2016 and started all four of his nation\\'s matches at the tournament.\\nHonours.\\nHamilton Academical\\nWigan Athletic\\nCeltic\\nIndividual'),\n ('8033218',\n  'Thomas Newport, 1st Baron Torrington',\n  'Thomas Newport, 1st Baron Torrington (c. 1655 – 27 May 1719), styled The Honourable from 1675 until 1716, was an English barrister and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1716 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Torrington.\\nEarly life.\\nBorn in High Ercall, Newport was the fifth and second surviving son of Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford, and his wife Lady Diana Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford.

The consensus, however, is that Umar was born at Mecca around 580 AD. The house in which Umar was born in Mecca was situated midway between Safa and Marwah.

In Germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology. In Göttingen Johann Matthias Gesner began to revive Greek studies and a new humanistic spirit. His successor, Christian Gottlob Heyne, worked with Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and laid the foundations for mythological research both in Germany and elsewhere. Heyne approached the myth as a philologist and shaped the educated Germans\\' conception of antiquity for nearly half a century, during which ancient Greece exerted an intense influence on intellectual life in Germany.\\nComparative approaches.\\nThe development of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established the science of myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, Sir James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871, Edward Burnett Tylor published his \"Primitive Culture\", in which he applied the comparative method and tried to explain the origin and evolution of religion. Tylor\\'s procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. According to Robert Segal, however, Campbell’s \"romantic view of myth is the opposite of a rationalist view, one epitomized by the Victorian anthropologists Edward Tylor and James Frazer\". J.F. del Giorgio has added a new turn to the comparative approach, insisting in \"The Oldest Europeans\" about present Greek myths being generated by the clash between a Paleolithic European population and the incoming Indo-European tribes.\\nMax Müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world. Evans himself, while studying the Minoan world, drew regularly on Egyptian and Near Eastern evidence for comparison, and the discovery of the Hittite and Ugaritic civilizations has uncovered texts as well as monuments which offer comparative material for ritual and mythology.\\nPsychoanalytic interpretations.\\nSigmund Freud put forward the idea that symbolic communication does not depend on cultural history alone but also on the workings of the psyche. Thus, Freud introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. Dream interpretation is the basis of Freudian myth interpretation and Freud\\'s concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. This suggestion would find an important point of rapprochement between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in Freud\\'s thought.\\nCarl Jung extended the transhistorical, psychological approach with his theory of the \"collective unconscious\" and the archetypes (inherited \"archaic\" patterns), often encoded in myth, that arise out of it. According to Jung, \"myth-forming structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche\". Comparing Jung\\'s methodology with Campbell\\'s theory, Segal concludes that \"to interpret a myth Campbell simply identifies the archetypes in it. An interpretation of the \"Odyssey\", for example, would show how Odysseus’s life conforms to a heroic pattern. Jung, by contrast, considers the identification of archetypes merely the first step in the interpretation of a myth\". For Jung, myth is no more about gods than about the physical world; it is about the human mind and must be read symbolically. Karl Kerenyi, one of the founders of modern studies in Greek mythology, gave up his early views of myth, in order to apply Jung\\'s theories of archetypes to Greek myth.\\nOrigin theories.\\nThe origins of Greek mythology are an open question. In antiquity, historians such as Herodotus theorized that the Greek gods had been stolen directly from the Egyptians. Later on, Christian writers tried to explain Hellenic paganism through degeneration of Biblical religion. According to the Scriptural theory, all mythological legends (including Greek mythology) are derived from the narratives of the Scriptures, though the real facts have been disguised and altered. Thus Deucalion is another name for Noah, Hercules for Samson, Arion for Jonah etc. According to the Historical Theory all the persons mentioned in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends relating to them are merely the additions of later times. Thus the story of Aeolus is supposed to have risen from the fact that Aeolus was the ruler of some islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Allegorical theory supposes that all the ancient myths were allegorical and symbolical. According to the Physical theory the elements of air, fire, and water were originally the objects of religious adoration, and the principal deities were personifications of the powers of nature.\\nThe sciences of archaeology and linguistics have been applied to the origins of Greek mythology with some interesting results. Historical linguistics indicates that particular aspects of the Greek pantheon were inherited from Indo-European society (or perhaps both cultures borrowed from another earlier source), as were the roots of the Greek language. Prominent Sanskritist Max Müller attempted to understand an Indo-European religious form by tracing it back to its Aryan, Vedic, \"original\" manifestation. In 1891, he claimed that \"the most important discovery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind [...] was this sample equation: Sanskrit Dyaus-pitar = Greek Zeus = Latin Jupiter = Old Norse Tyr\". Philologist Georges Dumezil draws a comparison between the Greek Uranus and the Sanskrit Varuna, although there is no hint that he believes them to be originally connected. In other cases, close parallels in character and function suggest a common heritage, yet lack of linguistic evidence makes it difficult to prove, as in the case of the Greek Moirai and the Norns of Norse mythology.\\nArchaeology and mythography, on the other hand, has revealed that the Greeks were inspired by some of the civilizations of Asia Minor and the Near East. Adonis seems to be the Greek counterpart — more clearly in cult than in myth — of a Near Eastern dying god. His name is related to the Semitic invocation \"adon\" (Lord) and appears in other cultures as Dumuzi, Tammuz or Attis. Cybele is rooted in Anatolian culture, and much of Aphrodite\\'s iconography springs from the Semitic goddesses Inanna, Ishtar and Astarte. The theogonic myths current in the Near East in the second millennium BC, such as the myth of Anu, Kumarbi, and Teshub, contain significant stories of generational conflict. Meyer Reinhold argues that \"such Near Eastern theogonic concepts, involving divine succession through violence and generational conflicts for power, found their way — the route is not certain — into Greek mythology. Our prime source is the great theogonic poem of Hesiod\". Parallels between the earliest divine generations (Chaos and its children) and Tiamat in the \"Enuma Elish\" are also possible.\\nIn addition to Indo-European and Near Eastern origins, some scholars have speculated on the debts of Greek mythology to the still poorly understood pre-Hellenic societies of Greece, such as the Minoans and so-called Pelasgians. This is especially true in the case of chthonic deities and mother goddesses. Historians of religion were fascinated by a number of apparently ancient configurations of myth connected with Crete: the god as bull — Zeus and Europa; Pasiphaë who yields to the bull and gives birth to the Minotaur; agrarian mysteries with a sacred marriage (Demeter\\'s union with Iasion) etc. Crete, Mycenae, Pylos, Thebes and Orchomenus figure so large in later Greek mythology. For some, the three main generations of gods in Hesiod\\'s \"Theogony\" (Uranus, Gaia, etc.; the Titans and then the Olympians) suggest a distant echo of a struggle between social groups, mirroring the three major high cultures of Greek civilization: Minoan, Mycenaean and Hellenic. Martin P. Nilsson, Professor of Classical Archaeology, worked on the structure, origins and relationships of the Indo-European languages, and concluded that all great classical Greek myths were tied to Mycenaen centres and were anchored in prehistoric times. Nevertheless, according to Walter Burkert, the iconography of the Cretan Palace Period has provided almost no confirmation of all these theories; nothing points to a bull, sexual symbols are absent and a single seal impression from Knossos showing a boy beneath a sheep is regarded as a scant evidence for the myth of Zeus\\' childhood.'),\n ('8033518',\n  '63rd Grey Cup',\n  'The 63rd Grey Cup was played on November 23, 1975, before 32,454 fans at McMahon Stadium in Calgary.

The game-time temperature was -15 degrees Celsius, and a 25-kilometre-per-hour wind played havoc with passing and kicking.\\nAlouette coach Marv Levy\\'s third-quarter decision to gamble on a 3rd-and-3 inside the Edmonton 10 proved to be a turning point, as a successful field goal would have provided sufficient margin for a Montreal victory. Instead, the Eskimos held and kept the Alouettes off the scoreboard. Nevertheless, the Als still had the win within their grasp. With just 3:49 left to play, Sonny Wade came off the Alouette bench to replace starting quarterback Jimmy Jones. Trailing 9-7 and starting from the Montreal 23-yard-line, Wade threw a 26-yard bullet to Larry Smith. He then faked a reverse to Johnny Rodgers and threw a 46-yard pass to Joe Petty. This gave the Als a chance for the game-winning field goal in the final seconds of the game, but Jones mishandled the snap from centre. Don Sweet\\'s 19-yard attempt went wide for a single point and from there, the Eskimos were able to run out the clock.\\nTrivia.\\nEdmonton and Montreal have met in 11 Grey Cup clashes. The Alouettes prevailed at soggy Empire Stadium (Vancouver) in 1974, in the Ice Bowl of 1977 and in 2002.

It\\'s also the only Grey Cup where one player from each team was responsible for all the points scored. Also, for the first time since 1945, all the points were scored by Canadians.\\nThis game was the first Grey Cup played in the city of Calgary and the province of Alberta; it was also the last Grey Cup game held in Western Canada for eight years. Between 1976 and 1982, the game was held in alternating years in either Toronto or Montreal.\\nThis was, until the 2015 Grey Cup, the last Grey Cup championship for the Eskimos that did not involve Hugh Campbell in some capacity with the team; he would be hired as its head coach in 1977, and aside from a brief break from 1983 to 1985, won nine Grey Cups (including five in a row from 1978 to 1982) with the team as either a head coach or general manager until his retirement in 2006.\\nThis was the first Grey Cup appearance of future prime minister Justin Trudeau, then almost four years old, brought to the game by his father, Pierre Trudeau.'),\n ('8033525',\n  'PIC (markup language)',\n  'In computing, Pic is a domain-specific programming language by Brian Kernighan for specifying line diagrams.\\nThe language contains predefined basic linear objects: line, move, arrow, and spline, the planar\\nobjects box, circle, ellipse, arc, and definable composite elements.\\nObjects are placed with respect to other objects or absolute coordinates.\\nA liberal interpretation of the input invokes\\ndefault parameters when objects are incompletely specified.\\nAn interpreter translates this description into\\nconcrete drawing commands in a variety of possible output formats.\\nPic is a procedural programming language, with variable assignment, macros, conditionals, and looping.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty\\'s Prison Service.\\nHistory.\\nMaidstone Prison is one of the oldest penal institutions in the United Kingdom, having been in operation for over 200 years.\\nOriginally serving as a county jail, Maidstone was converted to a prison during the 1740s. During his visits to the prison, reformer John Howard reported poor living conditions at the prison including overcrowding and poor ventilation. However, conditions would remain unchanged until a reconstruction of the prison took place under the supervision of Daniel Asher Alexander, who had worked on the construction of Dartmoor Prison, lasting from 1811 until its completion in 1819 at a cost of £200,000. Also involved in the design of Maidstone Prison was Kent architect John Whichcord Snr, who was Surveyor to the County of Kent from the 1820s. Mr Whichcord is probably best known for designing the Kent County Lunatic Asylum in the 1830s, also in Maidstone, and similarities between the two buildings are apparent.\\nConstructed using Kentish Ragstone from a local quarry, the original design of the prison was intended to house 552 prisoners, including 62 female inmates. The first 141 prisoners arrived in March 1819.\\nOver the next decade, additions to the prison were made including a courthouse in 1826 as well as individual cells, dayrooms, courtyards and offices attributed to suggestions made by Howard. Other reforms later included a strictly enforced segregation of prisoners by offence and the general improvement of living conditions such as improving the water supply, sanitation and ventilation systems, many of these renovations were made with prison labour over the course of the century.\\nBy the late 20th century, the only remaining signs of the original prison are the large and small roundhouses, the Weald Wing, the Administrative Block, the Training Complex, the Visits Building and the perimeter wall.\\nIn August 2007, Weald Wing was closed when Legionella bacteria was discovered in the water supply. Approximately 80 prisoners were dispersed to other prisons.\\nAt the end of January, 2009 it was announced that the prison would become a sex offenders\\' unit.\\nPresent-day.\\nMaidstone accommodates foreign national prisoners convicted of a range of offences; many are deported at the end of their sentence. The prison is classed as a \"training prison\" and it includes a print shop and brick works. A good deal of work is carried out on the gardens, they frequently win awards, and a new environmental garden area is being developed.\\nMedia appearances.\\nThe exterior of Maidstone Prison was shown in the title sequence (and some episodes) of the 1970s BBC comedy series \"Porridge\" and the 1990s BBC comedy series \"Birds of a Feather\".'),\n ('8033555',\n  'Christopher Poulsen',\n  'Christopher Poulsen (born 11 September 1981) is a retired Danish professional footballer player who plays as defender and current manager of Lemming IF.\\nHe previously played for Superliga clubs Silkeborg IF and FC Midtjylland.\\nPlayer career.\\nPoulsen played one game for the Denmark national under-21 football team in November 2002.

The vest is currently the new FSBE II system, and has replaced the FSBE AAVs. It features PALS webbing, making it MOLLE compatible and allowing the attachment of various pouches or accessories. Two versions of the vest are available known as the \"Land\" and the \"Maritime\" versions. The vest consists of front and rear panels with pockets for BALCS or SPEAR cut soft armor panels and standard issue SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert) plates. This gives the wearer up to NIJ Level IV protection on front and back and Level IIIA protection on the sides. On the lower rear side of the front of the vest there are two quick-releasable buckles for attaching groin protection. The wearer\\'s sides are covered by an external cummerbund which is also covered with PALS webbing. The vest body is constructed of 1000 Denier Cordura Nylon and the interior is lined with heavy duty mesh to aid in cooling the wearer.\\nThe difference between the “Land” and “Maritime” versions is how the outer cummerbund is attached at the front and where the quick-release handle is located. Both comes with an internal cummerbund which overlaps across the stomach and is secured with Velcro. The \"Maritime\" version has a solid center panel and two side flaps with Velcro panels underneath of them. Each side of the cummerbund attaches to the Velcro on its corresponding side. The release handle is located at the top of the front panel near the wearer\\'s neck which allows ambidextrous use. This version provides the wearer with a wide, uninterrupted section of webbing on the center of the vest which allows pouches for multiple magazines to be placed on the center of the body for easy access. On the Land version the external cummerbund wraps around and overlaps over the user\\'s stomach and is secured under a single center flap rather than the two side flaps of the \"Maritime\" version. The release handle on the \"Land\" vest is located on the left side of the front panel, just above where the cummerbund wraps around. This version breaks up the amount of continuous webbing on the user\\'s front, but allows the vest to be fitted with a different cummerbund which has additional pockets for 6x8\" side plates. The addition of these plates can bring the vest of to full Level IV protection for the entire torso, meaning the vest can stop rifle rounds from all sides instead of just front and back.\\nAdditionally, both the \"Land\" and \"Maritime\" versions can be fitted with extra coverage for the neck, biceps, deltoids, and, as previously mentioned, the groin area. These inserts provide up to Level IIIA coverage except for the groin which has a Level IV plate available.\\nCritiques of this vest include its weight when fully loaded with plates and inserts, its lack of \"breathing\" due to its coverage, and difficulty donning the vest by oneself.\\nThere are khaki, ranger green, olive drab, black, coyote brown, UCP, and multicam color variations for the CIRAs, and the manufacturer number for consumer goods does not have a contract number.\\nThe MAR-CIRAS is the armor carrier of choice for USSOCOM (BALCS-R). Many SEAL operators use the Khaki Maritime MAR-CIRAS.\\nThe United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance operators use the CIRAS (Both Land or Maritime versions) during different missions. \\nRelease feature.\\nBoth versions of the CIRAS come with a quick-release cable; with a pull of the handle, a steel cable holding the cummerbund and shoulder straps in place is released, allowing rapid removal of the vest. This is utilized for decontamination procedures, medical access needs, and water emergencies where the weight of the vest can cause the wearer to drown unless removed quickly. This last reason was the primary initiative behind the design of quick release vests as a helicopter crash in 1999 led to several US Marines drowning because they could not remove all their layers of armor and load bearing equipment fast enough. This is also described under the Full Spectrum Battle Equipment Amphibious Assault Vest entry, which the CIRAS was developed from. At the time this vest was introduced, it was a unique feature, but it has since been replicated on a number of other vests. The current vest uses a simplified system to attach and release the vest components, making reassembly quicker and easier.

The study attracted significant attention since it hinted at the possibility for a runaway positive feedback within the global climate system.\\nIn 1972, Budyko published forecasts focusing on Arctic sea ice and global mean temperature extending out 100 years.

Observations have since corroborated his figures, recording that mean global temperature increased by over this period and that the extent of multiyear Arctic sea ice in September 2019 was about 46% smaller than in 1970. He predicted that Earth\\'s mean global temperature would increase about by 2070.\\nIn 1972, Budyko calculated that a mere few tenths of one percent increase in solar radiation input could melt the ice caps.

Holmes spent the next six years drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.\\nHolmes was keenly involved with the details of the Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the college opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.\\nBiography.\\nBorn in Salem, Massachusetts, Holmes moved to Michigan in 1835, and gained employment in a Detroit merchant store. Within five years he had married his boss\\'s daughter, and soon became a partner in the family business. Holmes served as president of the Detroit Horticultural Society in 1847. The following two years he was a member of the Board of Education of Detroit. Then in 1849 he co-founded the Michigan State Agricultural Society.\\nThe Michigan State Agricultural Society immediately assumed a lofty goal to foster the establishment of an agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes, who served as secretary of the Agricultural Society from 1849 to 1857, was also the college\\'s most tenacious proponent. In conference with his fellow society members, he drafted a bill that would create the college. Significantly, Holmes vehemently admonished that this college be independent of the University of Michigan for he \"feared that agricultural studies would not receive the attention needed to survive and thrive\" at those schools.\\nHolmes spent the next five years gathering supporters for his movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He spent the next four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.\\nHolmes\\' work had only begun: Act 130 put the Agricultural Society wholly in charge of selecting the site for the Agricultural College. In June 1855, Holmes and the society\\'s executive committee visited nine sites of offered land, including some near the present towns of Holt, Millett, DeWitt, and Haslett. As a result of the low stipulated price of $15 per acre, all of the sites were uncleared land, and many were quite untenable for a campus. Eventually, Holmes wrote the proposal to purchase the Burr farm, located three miles due east of the capitol. He also included a second proposal, outlining both the college\\'s organization and \"specific appointments for a staff.\"\\nThe State Board of Education approved the site purchase in July 1855, but months later had proven unable to make any progress in deciding on basics for the college—including what buildings it might require. The Board turned to Holmes, who had continued to acquaint himself with the site by making some preliminary surveys. After some consideration, he reported back to the Board that the school required two main buildings: a combination classroom and office building, and a dormitory. Thus, John C. Holmes is the man responsible for the design of both College Hall and the original dormitory, now known as Saints\\' Rest. In addition, although Professor Harold W. Lautner (who, as the official Director of Campus Planning from 1945 to 1969, was a direct successor to Holmes) makes a point of noting that \"who proposed the sites for these first buildings is not answered in any record,\" he concurs that Holmes\\' ubiquitous hand makes it unlikely that anyone else made that decision.\\nThe buildings were completed, and the first classes commenced in May 1857. As the college began operations, Holmes was appointed its treasurer. Showing that no decision was small enough to escape his view, he is said to have \"supervised the placing of chairs and tables in College Hall.\" The college\\'s 200-volume library was donated by the Michigan State Agricultural Society—curiously, this meant that Holmes (as secretary of the society) had conveyed the library to himself (as treasurer of the college).\\nIn addition to treasurer, Holmes was appointed as the school\\'s first superintendent of horticulture, responsible for campus planning and planting. This title was used alternately with Professor for a short period. On February 2, 1858, the Horticulture Professorship was suspended, ostensibly for financial reasons (as well as the fact that the wild condition of the land hardly warranted a full-time horticulturalist as yet). Even so, Holmes was allowed to continue residing in one of the original on-campus Faculty Row houses until the end of the term.\\nThen, on March 8, 1859, Holmes was asked to resign as treasurer, and he complied. Some time in that year or the one following, he was appointed once again as Superintendent of Horticulture, guiding students in planting the college gardens and improving the grounds. Through 1861 he continued to be listed in the college catalog under various titles including Professor of Horticulture, Secretary, and Treasurer.\\nLegacy.\\nIn 1861, a major reorganization of the college transferred control from the Board of Education to the newly formed Board of Agriculture. Holmes was \"not retained despite the urging of his colleagues and the unquestioned spiritual debt which the College owed him.\" Holmes returned to the Detroit area, lived another twenty-six years, and remained active in his community. Although he continued to be, as President T. C. Abbot wrote circa 1883, \"a not infrequent and always welcome visitor at the college, and one of its warmest friends,\" Holmes never again held any official position at the college. There is no known explanation for this change of fortune, but as Lautner wrote, \"clearly there were troubles here other than financial ones that are not suggested in the minutes.\"\\nProfessor Lautner contrasts Holmes\\' legacy with that of John Harvard, whose donation of a modest library and four hundred British pounds led to a major university that bears his name, implying that MSU\\'s debt to Holmes is far greater. Professor William J. Beal called him \"the most important agent\" of the school, while President Abbot said, \"To no one man is the College so much indebted as John Clough Holmes.\" One hundred years after the founding, Madison Kuhn\\'s high regard for Holmes was clear, using as the frontispiece of his book a painting clearly meant to signify the exact moment of the Agricultural College\\'s genesis with an almost mythological glow. Finally in 1965, MSU named a new six story modernist residence hall after Holmes. The building still stands to this day, and is home to the Lyman Briggs College.'),\n ('8033694',\n  'Simon Darby',\n  'Simon Darby (born 8 November 1964) is a British politician and former Deputy Chairman of the British National Party.\\nBackground.\\nBy occupation a communications consultant, Darby began his political career in the National Democrats, most of whose activity was centred on his West Midlands base. Darby joined the BNP when his local National Democrat group defected to the party en bloc; he soon became associated with the modernising wing of the party led by Nick Griffin. He was appointed local organiser following Griffin\\'s election as leader, and was courted for membership by the Freedom Party on its foundation, although he refused to leave the BNP.\\nDarby\\'s involvement in local politics led to him being elected to Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council in 2003. He lost the seat in a round of elections the following year. Despite this loss, Darby remained one of the leading figures in the BNP, to the extent that Griffin, who in 2005-06 faced jail before being cleared of inciting racial hatred, designated Darby as party leader should he have been imprisoned.\\nDarby stood in the 2007 Welsh National Assembly Elections in the North Wales region but was not elected.\\nLater party career.\\nNewspaper reports identify Darby as the BNP\\'s deputy leader in 2007. He became a personal assistant to Richard Barnbrook following the latter\\'s election as the BNP\\'s representative on the Greater London Authority in May 2008. In this capacity, in November 2008 Darby faced criticism after admitting carrying out BNP party political work from his office as Barnbrook\\'s assistant at City Hall; Darby denied that he used GLA resources and said that he always made up any office hours spent on party activities. Darby is now the national press officer for the BNP.\\nIn 2009, Darby was criticised after pictures showed a member of an Italian political rally giving a Fascist style salute while Darby spoke on stage. When asked about the incident, Darby responded, \"I can\\'t do anything about that. There were 500 people and three of them were caught doing that stupid behaviour.\" In May the same year, he clashed with Archbishop Dr John Sentamu: Sentamu had condemned the BNP for labelling British citizens of African and Asian descent as \"racial foreigners\"; defending his comments, Darby insisted that \"If I went there and preached down to those indigenous people in the same way that Sentamu does to us then I\\'d be attacked. If I was derogatory, condescending and arrogant - because that\\'s what John Sentamu is - I would be attacked. And rightly so.\"\\nOn 1 July 2010, Darby resigned his role as deputy chairman citing impartiality regarding the then forthcoming 2010 BNP leadership election challenge, stating on his blog, \"I didn\\'t really want to be drawn into the leadership question, however, it seems the inevitable has happened, with adversaries of Nick Griffin raising the issue of the position of Deputy Leader in general, and referring to me in particular. As you know, the position carries absolutely no constitutional weight, and I feel it totally unfair and underhand, in a potential contest that involves solely the leader of the party, that some are seeking to confuse matters by bringing up the position of Deputy\".

Most of these transmitters plug into the device\\'s headphone jack and then broadcast the signal over an FM broadcast band frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio. This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home audio system or car stereo without requiring a wired connection. They are often used in cars but may also be in fixed locations such as broadcasting from a computer sound card throughout a building.\\nBeing low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100–300 feet (30–100 metres), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM frequency from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz in most of the world, 76.0 - 95.0 MHz for Japan, 65.0 - 74.2 MHz for Russia, and 88.1 to 107.9\\xa0MHz in the US and Canada.\\nUses.\\nPersonal FM transmitters are commonly used as a workaround for playing portable audio devices on car radios that don\\'t have an Auxiliary \"AUX\" input jack or Bluetooth audio connectivity. They are also used to broadcast a stationary audio source, like a computer or a television, around a home. They can also be used for low-power broadcasting and pirate radio but only to a very limited audience in near proximity. They can also be used as a \"talking sign\" in real estate sales or similar. Devices can be operated by connecting to the audio source or to a proprietary port of a specific device it is made for. In addition, certain devices such as hands-free car kits, navigation tools such as the TomTom GO, mobile phones like some Nokia Nseries models, and MP3 players may have FM transmitters built-in, however this has become uncommon.\\nLegality.\\nThe legality and maximum permitted power levels or field strengths of these devices varies by country.

Donovan, his face hidden behind a white porcelain mask, is seen plotting the final stage of his Project Alpha: Phase Four. Donovan orders Lisa, who is still working with him on her research, to bring Miyako, who too is part of their new organization MIST, to a secret laboratory located under the rig.\\nVarious characters are shown entering the fifth DOA tournament, which takes place at the platform. Each does it for their own reasons, often to either see once more or to defeat some other character. Usually they join it after either being approached by Zack, who is shown finding, fighting and recruiting them around the world. After Tina decides to return to fighting, her father Bass enters it as well, adopting a ring name of Mr. Strong; eventually, they reunite as a team. While stalking Jann Lee, Leifang eventually confronts him before the tournament and there is sexual tension between them. Hitomi, who still hopes to see Ein (Hayate), advances to the quarterfinals, defeating Mila and then Eliot. During a break, Hitomi meets Hayate, who wishes her good luck. Jann Lee, who had won constructive matches against Leifang and Mr. Strong, defeats her, emerging as the winner from the tournament but not attending the championship award ceremony out of a personal grudge for Rig, whom he lost to in an earlier fight.\\nIn Japan, Ryu Hayabusa is approached by Hayate and joins him and Ayane. Helena informs them that the Phase Four will see a mass production of Kasumi clones to sell them to top militaries in the world. Feeling that something is wrong with Kasumi, Hayate orders Ayane to follow her and discover her real intentions. Frustrated with her failure to track down Alpha, Kasumi returns to Helena, demanding to be told the truth, and Helena directs her to the platform. There, Hayate wins the right to follow her from Bayman. Kasumi discovers the lab, with Alpha-152 in it, and appears to destroy her clone. However, she is then attacked and mortally wounded by Hayate and Ayane, and dies in Ryu\\'s arms. This Kasumi is revealed to be merely a clone herself, but Ryu regrets her death anyway. Ryu destroys attacking helicopters (of the kind that attacked the rig earlier), while Hayate is captured in the lab by Rig, who turns out to be working with Donovan. Ryu sends a falcon with a message for the true Kasumi, who has been sheltering with Murumasa all that time; she immediately joins them up at the platform. In the lab, they defeat Rig, who escapes after saying it was a plan to lure them there. Lisa, dismayed to find out that Project Epsilon has been reactivated, frees Hayate. Alpha-152 then appears, taking forms of not only Kasumi but also of Hayate and Ryu, but Hayate and Ayane, Ryu and ultimately Kasumi succeed in destroying her along with the lab.\\nIn the epilogue, Kasumi peacefully parts her ways with Hayate and Ayane, as Ryu and Helena watch by, and promises to herself to bring down Donovan for good. In the post-end credits, a conversation between Rig and Donovan (the former revealed to be Donovan\\'s son) is heard. With Rig\\'s success in gathering samples from the fighters, Project Alpha can now move on to Phase Four.\\nDevelopment.\\nRumours and announcement.\\nBy January 2010, rumors about the next \"Dead or Alive\" game being developed for the PlayStation 3 had already circulated. GameSpot has listed the game as being exhibited by Koei Tecmo at their booth during the E3 2010.\\n\"Dead or Alive 5\" was officially announced in September 2011 at the Tokyo Game Show on September 14, 2011, for a 2012 release. The first trailer was released in December 2011. Producer Yosuke Hayashi said that the teaser image revealed at the event represents the sensuality that the game is now seeking to portray in a more sophisticated tone. At the time, the game was said to be only \"15% complete\". Hayashi said that his team was committed to making the environment more involved in the fighting experience than ever before and that they took \"a lot of inspiration\" from Naughty Dog\\'s action-adventure game series \"Uncharted\" for a creation of the more interactive and destructible stages and the dramatic Cliffhanger events.\\nProduction.\\nThe game engine of \"DOA5\" was built from scratch. To better balance the fighting system, Team Ninja decided to re-examine each of the characters, creating new moves from scratch when needed and carefully refining others. According to Hayashi, the entire project\\'s main concept was a decision to change direction and to focus on the characters\\' presence instead of on their beauty as in the previous games. They aimed to retain the characters\\' personalities and characteristics but to make them more lifelike and appealing for the players. In October 2011, the series\\' official Facebook page announced a contest inviting fans to create and submit their own fighting moves, some of which would be used in \"DOA5\" and their creators would have their names displayed in the game\\'s credits. Regarding an introduction of playable guest characters from the \"Virtua Fighter\" series, the characters\\' key animations were provided by Sega and Team Ninja created some more while working to implement them into the \"Dead or Alive\" gameplay system, which uses similar controls but features a different kind of matches. Hayashi said Team Ninja stayed in \"very close\" communication with Sega AM2: \"We got their guidance and feedback, we got them to check for everything we were doing with the characters.\" Hasayshi also said that he aimed to develop a crossover game in a manner similar to \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" and that he chose \"Virtua Fighter\" because it was \"the father of 3D gaming\", and also the first 3D game that he played and the IP he personally respects most.\\nEarly on, Hayashi said they attempted to move on from relying just on sex and violence: \"We’re trying to focus on the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [character] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up,\" as opposed to the previous concept of just \"make her breasts big and just make them jiggle.\" \"Dead or Alive 5\"s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game\\'s revised aesthetic direction: \"\"Dead or Alive\" is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in \"Dead or Alive 5\" - it\\'s part of the series, it\\'s part of its history and it\\'s part of why people like it. But we\\'re trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it.\" After the release, the game\\'s director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally \"getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters.\" However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: \"That was kind of surprising. There\\'s definitely still room for having sexualized aspects,\" adding that he \"really tries\" to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked \"what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in \"DOA5\" are sexist,\" he said their goal was to create \"the cutest chicks in videogames\" and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).\\nPromotion.\\nIn February 2012, Team Ninja hosted a series of press events in various locations across the world, showcasing the alpha demo of the game. Further screenshots have confirmed Hitomi and Ayane to be playable, while Kasumi was featured in a promotional poster. A trailer unveiled at the Game Developers Conference in March 2012 revealed that the game would include \"Virtua Fighter\"s Akira Yuki. In May 2012, Koei Tecmo attended London MCM Expo, showcasing a playable demo version of the game. \"Dead or Alive 5\" tournament was also held on the GameSpot stage. In June, KT attended the E3 2012, where the live-streamed IPN (IGN Pro League) \"Dead or Alive 5\" championship was held with a new beta demo version of the game. A trailer for the event revealed another \"Virtua Fighter\" guest character, Sarah Bryant. June saw the emergence of a new trailer confirming the addition of a brand new character to the series, Rig. In July, KT\\'s official YouTube channel MyKOEITV released a trailer showcasing tag team gameplay and showing a female fighter wearing a luchadora mask, later revealed to be La Mariposa. The \"Official Declaration\" trailer released in August confirmed the return of Alpha-152. In September, two weeks before the game\\'s release, KT announced another brand new character to join the roster, a female vale tudo and kickboxing artist named Mila, while \"Virtua Fighter\"s Pai Chan was also revealed to make an appearance. The game\\'s launch trailer was released on September 19. \\nRelease.\\n\"Dead or Alive 5\" was first released in North America on September 25, 2012, followed by other parts of the world within a week. A day 1 patch addressed numerous issues with the game, including balance tweaks to most characters and some minor improvements to the online mode.\\nOn December 1, it was announced that an \"expanding patch\" is planned to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions in early 2013 and also that IPL is going to hold the official \"Dead or Alive 5\" competition in 2013. Team Ninja said the patch will aim to carefully rebalance the game: \"Rather than kill personality to make everyone the same, we’ll strengthen the weak characters to make a fair fight.\" The team also invited customers to send constructive criticism and suggestions about balancing to them via Twitter.\\nMarketing and merchandise.\\nA game demo of \"Dead or Alive 5\" was released with \"Ninja Gaiden 3\" in March 2012, featuring four playable characters. The Xbox 360 version of the demo allows the use of Hayabusa and Hitomi, while the PlayStation 3 version makes Hayate and Ayane playable. The collector\\'s edition of \"Ninja Gaiden 3\" makes all four characters playable.\\nTecmo Koei collaborated with several retail outlets on pre-order bonuses available through several store chains throughout the world. Bonuses included in-game bunny-style swimsuits for Kasumi, Leifang and Hitomi from GameStop, the in-game \"DOA Devils\" black swimsuits for Christie, Tina and Ayane from Amazon, and a Kasumi-themed iPhone 4 case from ShopTo. The \"Dead or Alive 5 Collectors Edition\", available from various retailers in North America and Europe, includes a metal case, a hardcover art book, a soundtrack CD, a poster of the game\\'s characters, and a \"Premium Sexy Costume\" for each of 12 female characters that gives one swimsuit per character.\\nStand-alone merchandise for the game include official guides by Koei and Prima Games, an arcade stick by Hori decorated with a graphic of Ayane and Kasumi (bundled with limited versions for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360), and a clothing line by Tecmo Koei and Insert Coin (including a hoodie based on one of Hitomi\\'s costumes in the game). Other, later released merchandise included 3D mousepads featuring Ayane, Hitomi or Kasumi, and dakimakura pillow cases featuring Ayane, Kasumi, Hitomi, Kokoro or Leifang.\\nDownloadable content.\\nThe first downloadable content, Costume Packs Round 1, was released on October 2, providing new outfits for several of the characters and available for free. The first purchasable DLC, Costume Packs Round 2 (featuring costume sets \"Kitty Pack\", \"What a Character\" and \"Special Set\"), was released two weeks later, available either sold separately or through \"Full Set\" containing all three at a reduced price. It was followed by Costume Packs Round 3 (with costume sets \"Gym Class\", \"Uniform\" and \"Special Set 2\"), released at the end of October, and Costume Packs Round 4 (with costume sets \"Angels\", \"Devils\" and \"DOATEC Divas\", some of them previously made available as preorder bonuses for the disc version) and Player\\'s Swimwear Pack (also with three sub-packs and previously included in the \"Collector\\'s Edition\"), released in mid-November, all of them also with a price discount for choosing a \"Full Set\" version. Two more costume packs were announced to follow up later in 2012 (in late November and December). More downloadable content, including \"Hotties Swimwear\" and \"Zack Island stage\" was released in February 2013, along with a major patch for the game. \\nReception.\\nPre-release.\\nPrior to release, professional gamer Kayane declared \"Dead or Alive 5\" the most beautiful fighting game she had ever seen. In a positive preview, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" stated, \"the resurgence and appreciation for [fighting games] has only happened recently with reboots or re-imaginings of cherished titles, and \"DOA5\" is one of these reboots. More accurately, \"DOA5\" is a rebirth.\" \"X360\" ranked \"Dead or Alive 5\" as the third most sexy game coming over in 2012.\\nReviews.\\nThe full version of \"Dead or Alive 5\" was met with a generally positive critical response. Reviewers typically praised the game\\'s graphics and animation, as well as the spectacularity of the fights and their deeper gameplay mechanics. However, several reviews criticized the story mode and aspects of its online features. Some of the reviewers also expressed disappointment with what they thought was Team Ninja\\'s failure to innovate enough as compared to previous titles in the series and the other new games in the genre.\\n\"Famitsu\" was the first publication to review the game, giving it a very high score of 36/40 (rated 9/10 by all four reviewers). IGN\\'s Vincent Ingenito described \"Dead or Alive 5\" as a \"formidable, enormously entertaining fighter\" and the deepest game in the \"Dead or Alive\" series, praising the new gameplay mechanics, \"gorgeous\" and \"stunning\" visuals, \"memorable and lovingly crafted\" interactive stages, \"insanely deep\" practice mode as well as online features, and calling it \"without any question, the best entry in the series.\" According to GamesRadar\\'s Giancarlo Saldana, \"Dead or Alive 5\" features \"better than ever\" graphics and its improved fighting system \"is another step in the right direction,\" and while \"the game’s story mode leaves much to be desired,\" \"Dead or Alive 5\"s \"new fighting mechanics and flashy stage effects turn battles into an entertaining, over-the-top experience.\" Joystiq\\'s Ludwig Kietzmann called \"Dead or Alive 5\" a \"success as an energetic revitalization of the series.\" Kotaku\\'s Mike Fahey wrote that \"while \"Dead or Alive 5\" is far from a complete overhaul of the series, it charges into the fighting game scene with all the spirit of a completely new game.\" Ernest Lin of PlayStation Universe stated that the \"stages are the most awe-inducing spectacles ever seen in a fighting game\" and \"despite its shortcomings, \"DOA5\" is the best \"Dead or Alive\" period.\"\\nGameSpot\\'s Maxwell McGee applauded \"Dead or Alive 5\" for its gameplay system, \"impressive\" graphics and \"outstanding reality\" in regards to characters and environments, and did not mind the plot — stating it to be \"entertaining in its ridiculousness\" — but criticized the game\\'s practice mode and some online features, overall calling it \"a dynamic fighter that can be enjoyed by players of all skill types.\" Andy Hartup of \"Computer and Video Games\" called the training modes \"absolutely superb\", but criticized the game for its \"bizarre\" story mode and because it \"[lacked] the complexity of \"Street Fighter\",\" summarizing that although \"DOA5\" \"isn\\'t perfect\", it is \"cracking fun, a fighter that\\'s great to watch and feels even better to play.\" Destructoid\\'s Ian Bonds called it \"a delicious surprise\" that is \"fun without being frustrating, the all-around fighter for everyone. Even the ones who won\\'t admit to enjoying the T&amp;A.\"\\nHowever, Dan Ryckert of \"Game Informer\" was much more critical of the elements like the game\\'s story and online play system, and especially the series\\' perceived lack of substantial progress in some areas such as character customization, stating that this \"decent fighter\" is years behind the competition and Team Ninja is \"showing its age.\" \"Edge\" described it as \"mostly business as usual\" with \"tweaks to the formula and aesthetic, but nothing too sacrilegious or enticing.\" G4TV\\'s Sophie Prell called it merely a \"refinement and re-balancing of \"Dead or Alive 4\",\" adding that the game is \"the most welcoming to newcomers\" while \"hardcore fans\" of fighting games might need to keep their \"expectations in check\". According to Matt Edwards of Eurogamer, \"\"DOA5\" doesn\\'t tarnish the series\\' solid and sassy reputation — far from it — but it falls short of an evolutionary leap in terms of combat mechanics and a substantial expansion in terms of single-player.\"\\nLike previous installments of the \"Dead or Alive\" franchise, the game was criticized for objectifying women\\'s bodies. A review in \"Metro\" pointed to the series as mostly known for its focus on the breasts of the female characters, alleging that \"the majority of its characters are all impossibly well-endowed women, whose breasts wobble about their chest like a pair of blancmanges [...] portrayed as simpering, personality-free automatons.\" An attempt during development of \"Dead or Alive 5\" to \"tone down the sexuality\" due to outside criticism was reversed due to criticism from long-term fans and testers. In response to criticism of sexualization of female characters, creative director of the games development team pointed to the fact that the game\\'s \"actions, aesthetics and overall visual presentation is more than obviously set in a light-hearted, over-the-top, candy coated universe\" and stated that \"we also don\\'t feel that we are demeaning women.\"\\nSales and awards.\\nIn May, Tecmo Koei announced that it aims to sell one million copies of the game. First week sales in Japan were strong where the game sold more than 80,000 copies, mostly for the PS3. On October 29, 2012, it was reported that the game sold 580,000 units worldwide during the first month after its release. According to Tecmo Koei, downloadable content sales and retail pre-orders have also been favorable. Joystiq commented that the figure \"compares reasonably to the 700,000 copies \"Dead or Alive 4\" shipped worldwide in its first two months.\" Its main rival game, \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", also released in September, has sold 840,000 units by November 2, 2012. By June 2015, all versions of the game combined sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide, along with 3.5 million downloads of the free-to-play versions of \"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate\" and \"Dead or Alive 5 Last Round\".\\n\"Dead or Alive 5\" was given the title of \"Best of Fighters\" of Gamescom 2012 by Destructoid and was nominated for \"People\\'s Choice Award\" by IGN. At E3 2012 it was nominated for the \"Best Fighting Game\" by Game Critics Awards (losing to \"\") and G4TV. It was also nominated at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards in the category \"Best Fighting Game\" of the year (losing to \"Persona 4 Arena\"), and for Destructoid\\'s title of best fighting game of 2012 (losing also to \"Persona 4 Arena\") as well as for GameSpot\\'s \"Fighting Game of the Year\" (losing to \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\"). \"Dead or Alive 5\" has been nominated for \"Best Console\" game in the IGN Australia\\'s Black Beta Select Awards 2012 and Digital Spy chose it as one of the 20 nominees for an overall \"Game of the Year\" of 2012. Russian magazine \"Igromania\" gave it a title of the fighting game of the year. Polish web portal Interia.pl included the game\\'s Ayane, Christie and Kasumi among the \"sexiest game heroines\" of 2012.\\nLegacy.\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Plus\".\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Plus\" is an enhanced port of \"DOA5\" for the PlayStation Vita released in March 2013. The game adds more options for Training mode and a Touch Play mode. It was actually better received than the original \"DOA5\", holding the averaged review scores of 83.40% at GameRankings and 80/100 at Metacritic.\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate\".\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate\" is an updated version of \"DOA5\" released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, available at retail and digitally. \"Ultimate\" includes new modes and some features from \"Dead or Alive 5 Plus\", as well as several new stages and fighters (including \"Ninja Gaiden\"s Rachel and Momiji, and \"Virtua Fighter\"\\'s Jacky Bryant, as well as the return of \"Dead or Alive 2\" characters Leon and Hayate\\'s amnesiac karateka identity, Ein), and all-new features such as two-on-two online multiplayer tag team battles, among many other changes. Three new female characters: Marie Rose, Phase-4 and Nyotengu, joined the game\\'s roster in 2014.\\nA free digital version, titled \"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Core Fighters\", which features four playable characters and the online mode, with additional characters and story mode content available as purchasable downloadable content, was released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store alongside the retail version. An arcade version titled \"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Arcade\" was developed in a co-operation with Sega (Ringedge 2 Hardware) for a release only in Japan later in 2013, which is also including the three new characters who was introduced in this version as DLC for console version.\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Last Round\".\\n\"Dead or Alive 5 Last Round\" for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows (through Steam) was released in February 2015 for the consoles and the next month on Steam. It has a digital-only release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and a physical release for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including a free-to-play version for the latter consoles. Among other changes, the original \"Dead or Alive\" boss Raidou returns as a cyborg, along with a new female character named Honoka.

The program was specifically aimed at youth gun violence as a large-scale problem. The plan is based on the work of criminologist David M. Kennedy.\\nBoston.\\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, Boston, like many cities in the United States, experienced an epidemic of youth gun homicides. Violence was particularly concentrated in poor inner city neighborhoods including Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. Youth homicide (ages 24 and under) in Boston increased 230% - from 22 victims in 1987 to 73 in 1990. Between 1991 and 1995, Boston averaged about 44 youth homicides a year. Operation Ceasefire entailed a problem-oriented policing approach, and focused on specific places that were crime hot spots. Focus was placed on two elements of the gun violence problem: illicit gun trafficking and gang violence.\\nAt the outset, the strategy was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and was co-directed by David M. Kennedy, Anthony A. Braga, and Anne M. Piehl of Harvard University\\'s John F. Kennedy School of Government. The project, over the course of time, became unique, as it:\\nA core participating agency was defined as one that regularly participated in the Boston Gun Project Working Group over the duration of the project. The participating core agencies included the Boston Police Department; Massachusetts departments of probation and parole; the Suffolk County district attorney; the office of the United States Attorney; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (juvenile corrections); Boston school police; and gang outreach and prevention streetworkers attached to the Boston Community center program. Other important partners with more intermittent participation include the Ten Points Coalition, the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Massachusetts State Police.\\nDesign on the project began in 1995. It led to what is now known as the Group Violence Intervention (GVI), typically overseen by the National Network for Safe Communities, out of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, but has also been implemented independently by several jurisdictions. The Boston project launched in 1996 with an innovative partnership between practitioners and researchers. These groups came together to assess the youth homicide problem and implement the intervention, and found a substantial near-term impact on the problem. Operation Ceasefire was based on \"pulling levers policing\" deterrence strategies, which focus criminal justice enforcement on a small number of chronic offenders and gang-involved youth who were responsible for much of Boston\\'s homicide problem.\\nEarly impact evaluations suggested that the Ceasefire intervention was associated with significant reductions in youth homicide victimization, shots fired, calls for service, and gun assaults in Boston. Within two years of implementing Operation Ceasefire in Boston, the number of youth homicides dropped to ten, with one handgun-related youth homicide occurring in 1999 and 2000. After a change in supervising personnel within the Boston police department and city government, this first site was abandoned. Youth homicides began to climb again with 37 in 2005 and reaching a peak of 52 in 2010.\\nFindings and results.\\nThe Pareto principle in Ceasefire.\\nResearch on the Ceasefire method has found a profound and so far invariant connection between serious violence and highly active criminal groups. A typical city-level finding is that groups collectively representing under 0.5% of the city\\'s population will be connected as offenders, victims or both, with between half and three quarters of all homicide in the city—an example of the Pareto principle: a large proportion of the effects comes from a small proportion of the causes. This is likely to be an underestimate, as only incidents known to be connected to street groups are counted as such; a substantial portion of those not known will also be group connected.\\nIn Boston, for example, which at the time had a population of roughly 556,180 people, approximately 1,500 individuals were identified as comprising 61 separate groups. This 0.3% of the population was responsible for 60% of the city\\'s homicides. Similarly, in Cincinnati in 1997, which had an population of about 333,210, between 800 and 1,000 individuals—less than 0.3% of the population—were identified as being group related, and were responsible for 75% of the city\\'s homicides.\\nResults and impact.\\nStudies of Boston Operation Ceasefire found a 63% reduction in youth homicide. Since then, Operation Ceasefire has evolved into the National Network for Safe Communities\\' Group Violence Intervention. The Group Violence Intervention (GVI) has been deployed in dozens of cities – from Los Angeles to Providence, from Chicago to Nashville – over almost 20 years. A 2011 Campbell Collaboration Systematic Review of the strategies, and others related to them, concluded that there is now \"strong empirical evidence\" for their crime prevention effectiveness. Stockton\\'s Operation Peacekeeper produced an overall 42% reduction in gun homicide in the city. The Chicago extension of the national Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, has shown 37% reductions in homicide, while the Lowell, Massachusetts, Project Safe Neighborhoods efforts have produced 44% reductions in gun assault. A 34% reduction in homicide has been recorded in Indianapolis after the launch of the Indianapolis Violence Reduction Partnership. The Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) has shown a 41% reduction in street group member-related homicides.\\nAwards and recognition.\\nIn 2003, the program received the United States Department of Justice\\'s \"Outstanding Comprehensive Strategic Plan Award\".\\nIn fiction.\\nThe crime drama series \"City on a Hill\" shows a fictionalized account of Operation Ceasefire.'),\n ('8033943',\n  'Demographics of Dallas',\n  \"Dallas is the ninth-most populous city in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio.

The literary Tatar language did not have Indo-European roots and was most closely related to several Oriental languages, whose prestige decreased after the Russian revolution whereas knowledge of Russian increased and many Russian words entered into the literary language.\\nTatar–Russian code-switching is based in from the asymmetric bilingualism of Tatars and the introduction of Russian schools, as well as total decline of the national culture as defined by educated Tatars after the 1930s. Another major factor is that the most commonly used language in the cities is Russian. Although there were many Russian-speakers present before the Revolution, more arrived as the result of population transfer in the Soviet Union.

Many Spanish traits are still present in the island. Many traditional Spanish dishes have found a new home in the Dominican Republic, some with a twist. African and Taíno dishes still hold strong, some of them unchanged.\\nAll or nearly all food groups are accommodated in typical Dominican cuisine, as it incorporates meat or seafood; grains, especially rice, corn (native to the island), and wheat; vegetables, such as beans and other legumes, potatoes, \"yuca\", or plantains, and salad; dairy products, especially milk and cheese; and fruits, such as oranges, bananas, and mangos. However, there is heaviest consumption of starches and meats, and least of dairy products and non-starchy vegetables.\\nSofrito, a sautéed mix including local herbs and spices, is used in many dishes.

Because of the historic migration between Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico its three cultures are closely related. It is unclear for most dishes between these countries on where it originated from. Some dishes like mofongo and pastlese are from Puerto Rico and became a part of Dominican cuisine.

Alcohol drinks such as piña colada, coquito, Cuba libre, and mojitos from Cuba and Puerto Rico.\\nGeographical differences.\\nWhat Dominicans tend to eat depends highly on where they live: whether near the sea or in the interior mountains. In either case, most Dominican meat dishes tend to involve pork, as pigs are farmed quite heavily on the island. Meat dishes tend to be very well cooked or even stewed in Dominican restaurants, a tradition stemming from the lesser availability of refrigeration on the island.\\nSeaside Dominican fishing villages will have great varieties of seafood, the most common being shrimp, marlin, mahi-mahi or \"dorado\", and lobster.

The revolt was named after the small town of Kazym in the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Some sources describe the events as \"Kazym rebellions\", listing a series of conflicts starting in 1931, with some half-hearted attempts at reconciliation from Soviet side, but culminating in forceful suppression in 1933 and repression in 1934. \\nHistory.\\nIn the 1930s, the new settlement of Kazym was established by the government as a \"cultural base\". In theory, cultural bases were meant to entice the Khanty people into village life with the benefits of schools, hospitals, stores and other communal conveniences. This effort to collectivise native peoples into manageable communities did see a great many Khanty abandoning their forest homes. Still others were relocated forcibly during the Joseph Stalin years. Additionally, compulsory attendance in boarding schools located in towns such as Kazym meant that Khanty children were removed from traditional homes and, for many years, were forbidden to speak their native tongue or follow their cultural beliefs.\\nThis process went alongside the abduction and execution of traditional leaders who were labelled \"kulaks\" by the state. Eventually there was a revolt in 1933 by many Khanty with support from the Forest Nenets, which was later known as the Kazym rebellion. The revolt began in the lake Numto area and spread to the town of Kazym. Within several weeks it was crushed by the Red Army, which was reported to have slaughtered dozens of villagers and burned their homes. This was the last known conflict with Russia by any of the Siberian tribes.\\nAfter that, anyone who took part in the Bear Funeral Rites or other celebrations of Khanty culture was subject to 10 years imprisonment. Bear hunting was forbidden and anything connected with Khant culture, such as sacred ground, pagan shrines or burial grounds were destroyed.\\nThese laws were only relaxed during the 1980s as part of the glasnost policies of Mikhail Gorbachev.\\nIn literature and cinema.\\nYeremey Aypin (), a writer of Khanty-Mansi descent, wrote a novel titled \"Our Lady in the blood-splattered snow\" (), which was published in 2002 and served as a basis for a movie named \"The Khanty Saga\" () produced in 2008. The novel is a fictionalized version of the rebellion.'),\n ('8034041',\n  'Paul Draper (winemaker)',\n  'Paul Draper (born March 10, 1936) is a California winemaker who has been the chief winemaker at Ridge Vineyards in California since 1969. Without any formal training in winemaking, Draper first gained recognition for his 1971 \"Monte Bello\" Cabernet Sauvignon when it placed fifth at the Judgment of Paris wine tasting. Draper has played a significant role in the history of California wine through his pioneering work in popularizing \"vineyard-designated\" wines as well as instigating the resurgence of old vine Zinfandel. Along with Ravenswood Winery\\'s Joel Peterson, Draper is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Californian Zinfandel, rescuing the grape from obscurity and demonstrating its full potential as a serious wine. Draper was featured in a short film titled Terroir and directed by Christopher McGilvray which was shown at the 2017 Cinequest Film Festival.\\nEarly history.\\nBorn in Evanston, Illinois in 1936, Draper was raised on a farm and exposed to agriculture at an early age. He graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut and Stanford University, where he majored in philosophy and first became aware of Ridge Vineyard, which was then owned by a group of Stanford Research Institute engineers. After graduation in 1959, Draper joined the Army where he was stationed at Italy. During that time, in a desire to see the sights from his favorite film \"La strada\", Draper rode through the Italian countryside on a motorcycle, learning about the local culture, cuisine and wine. Following his release from the Army, he spent some time at Sorbonne studying French cuisine and nutrition. On his return to the United States, Draper went to work for at Chateau Souverain in Napa Valley as a cellar assistant with the harvest.\\nThe next year, Draper went to Chile as part of a Peace Corps mission where he leased a Chilean winery with Fritz Maytag, a fellow volunteer and friend from Stanford. Using Cabernet vines from local vineyards, Draper got first hand experience with winemaking in a very low-tech environment. During this time he also read many books on winemaking to expand his knowledge of the field. In 1968, he traveled to Bordeaux where he discussed winemaking with the \"maître de chai\" of Château Latour. The experience gave him the confidence he needed to meet with David Bennion and accept the chief winemaking position at Ridge Vineyards in 1969.\\nRidge Vineyards.\\nWhile Ridge had some success with Cabernet, the mission that Draper was charged with was to make Ridge \"respectable\". One of the first tasks that he set about was in modernizing the facilities of a winery that was first built in 1886. He then went to focus on Ridge\\'s Cabernet Sauvignon and became an advocate of the potential of cool climate Cabernet in contrast to the very ripe, highly alcoholic styles that came out of warmer climates. Located in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, the high altitude of Ridge\\'s vineyards as well as its proximity to the Pacific Ocean created a cooler climate that was distinctly different from that found in Napa Valley or Sonoma County. Draper also embraced the French wine concept of \"terroir\" and began producing single-vineyard wine that was designated on the wine label with the name of that vineyard. As the reputation of his wine grew, consumers soon began to recognize names such as Monte Bello, Picchetti Vineyard, Jimsomare and Geyserville from their vineyard-designated bottlings.\\nThe style of Draper\\'s Ridge Cabernets are often compared to more Old World styles like Bordeaux and have been reviewed by critics in favorable comparisons to the wines of the First Growths. That is a style that Draper actively tries to parallel and would often serve blind tastings of his Monte Bello Cabernet with a bottle of Château Latour to get feedback on the differences between the two. Draper retired as the CEO and Winemaker of Ridge Vineyards in 2016, but remained on as the chairman of the board.\\nJudgement of Paris.\\nThe 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon was selected by organizer Steven Spurrier to take part in his 1976 blind tasting that would pit the best of California wines against the best of France\\'s wines. On the tasting notes, Draper describes the 1971 vintage as the first vintage that they were able to achieve balance in the wine with less sugar in the grapes prior to harvest and the benefit of small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet franc. The wine was fermented dry with extended skin contact and then put through malolactic fermentation and aged in small American oak barrels. The wine was expected to hit its peak after 6 years in the bottle. Prior to the tasting, Spurrier expected the Ridge Monte Bello to be the best performing American red. In the final results it ended up being the fifth best overall red wine (and second best American wine) after Stag\\'s Leap Wine Cellars, Château Mouton Rothschild, Château Montrose and Château Haut-Brion.\\nIn the 2006 rematch, the 1971 Ridge was the highest ranked red wine beating out the 1973 Stag\\'s tastings of the same vintage wine as the original competition. A second tasting was held of more recent vintage wine in which the 2000 Monte Bello red wine came in second place behind a 2000 Château Margaux.\\nInfluence on California Zinfandel.\\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Zinfandel was primarily a jug wine grape. Draper sensed the potential of the wine if grown in the right spot and with low yields. Prior to his arrival, Ridge had been making some Zinfandel in small quantities, often blended with Carignane and Petite Sirah, but it was never much of a focus. Elsewhere, in California the grape was also drawing little interest from \"serious\" winemakers. Remembering the lessons he learned in Europe about the benefits of \"old vines\", particularly with keeping low yields, he went looking for some of the oldest vines of Zinfandel that he could find and found several vineyards with plantings from the 1880s-1900s. Over the course of his career he would uncover other \"ideal\" spots for Zinfandel including Spring Mountain, Howell Mountain, Dry Creek Valley, Mendocino, Lodi, Paso Robles, Amador County and Geyserville. While many of these areas had long histories of Zinfandel production, most of these areas never received much recognition until Draper and Ridge began using them and touting their \"terroir\" with vineyard-designated wines.\\nWinemaking philosophy.\\nDraper is an advocate of natural winemaking, though Ridge is not a certified organic winery. His view stems from his desire to let the vineyards \"express themselves\" and their \"terroir\" without over intrusiveness by man. He has been a critic of overly-powerful, over oak and highly alcoholic wines made from excessively ripe fruit, preferring his wines to be more about finesse and balance. He has also been a critic of high wine prices and consumers who purchase wine for speculating purposes rather than to enjoy them. He has been a harsh critic of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology in their emphasis of more \"industrial winemaking\" versus the traditional methods that he prefers. In contrast to other California Cabernets, Draper\\'s wines are normally around 13% ABV which is low even in comparison to Bordeaux wines. Though his wines are often more of a French style, he has preferred to use American oak because they seem to perform better with his wines.\\nOver the years Paul Draper has influenced a number of winemakers, both in California and abroad, with such notable wine personalities as Jean-Luc Colombo counting him as among his favorite non-European winemakers.\\nReferences.\\nDarlington, David, ANGEL\\'S VISITS An Inquiry into the Mystery of Zinfandel, Henry Holt and Company 1991, '),\n ('8034064',\n  'Comandante Fernández Department',\n  'Comandante Fernández Department is a central department of Chaco Province in Argentina.\\nThe provincial subdivision has a population of about 88,000 inhabitants in an area of 1,500\\xa0km², and its capital city is Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña, which is located around 1,120\\xa0km from the Capital federal.'),\n ('8034072',\n  'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag',\n  'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag – Journey Of A Woman () is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Pradeep Sarkar and starring Jaya Bachchan, Rani Mukherji, Konkona Sen Sharma, Kunal Kapoor, Anupam Kher and Abhishek Bachchan.

The film was the first directed by Sarkar under the Yash Raj Films banner.\\nPlot.\\nVibhavari, nicknamed Badki (\"the elder one\"), and Shubhavari, affectionately called Chutki (\"the younger one\"), are the daughters of Shivshankar Sahay and Savitri. They live on the banks of the Ganges in Banaras. Life is full of happiness and joy for the two sisters although the family is poor and their house badly needs repairs. Savitri struggles to financially support the family by sewing clothes, and Badki left school before completing 12th standard in order help her mother to earn more. Both Savitri and Badki are determined to ensure that Chutki completes her education, while Shivshankar spends his days buying lottery tickets and voicing his resentment that Badki was not born a son.\\nWhen her father becomes ill and greedy relatives threaten to sue the family for their house, Badki goes to Mumbai to find work, but she is continuously rejected due to her lack of education and qualifications. She begs her friend Karan to introduce her to his sleazy boss, Gupta, who offers her a job on condition that she sleeps with him. Desperate, Badki does so, only for Gupta to reveal that he had manipulated her for sex; he refuses her the job and throws money at her, leaving her anguished. Feeling defeated and out of options, Badki becomes an escort, taking only wealthy men as clients. Coached by Karan\\'s friend Michelle, Badki learns how to speak English and how to dress modernly and goes by the name \"Natasha.\" Badki lies to her father and Chutki that she found work as an event planner and sends money for Shivshankar\\'s medicines, house repairs, and a family lawyer. Although Savitri knows the truth and is pained by it, she does not dissuade Badki for fear of losing the steady flow of money. Through one of her clients, Badki meets and falls in love with attorney Rohan in Zurich but then leaves him fearing that he would be disgusted by her profession.\\nMeanwhile, Chutki completes her MBA and comes to live with Badki in Mumbai. She starts working at an agency and begins a relationship with her boss, creative director Vivaan, who soon proposes to her. While wedding preparations begin in Banaras, Savitri calls Chutki to implore her that Badki not attend the celebrations, for fear of Badki\\'s profession being discovered and bringing shame on the family. Chutki then inadvertently discovers Badki\\'s secret, and while initially upset, she apologizes to Badki for their family\\'s selfishness. Chutki fiercely vows to remain by Badki\\'s side and begs Badki to attend her wedding.\\nAt Chutki\\'s wedding in Banaras, Badki comes face-to-face with Rohan, who is revealed to be Vivaan\\'s older brother. Old feelings resurface between the two, and Rohan asks Badki to marry him. Badki refuses, feeling that Rohan would never accept her if he knew the truth, and informs her mother of his proposal. Savitri is terrified of the possibility of Chutki\\'s wedding being ruined and blames Badki for coming to Banaras. Chutki, however, rebukes her mother for overlooking Badki\\'s sacrifices for the family and urges Badki to finally put herself first, whatever consequences there might be for Chutki\\'s marriage. Shivshankar overhears this conversation and, along with Savitri, realizes what Badki has suffered for the family\\'s sake. Badki divulges her profession to Rohan, who shocks her by revealing that he knew from the moment they were introduced by her client in Zurich. He explains that he deeply admires her character and the sacrifices she made for her family and wants to marry her. Badki accepts, and the two couples marry in a joint wedding ceremony.\\nProduction.\\nSaif Ali Khan was initially approached for the role of Rohan that went to Abhishek Bachchan, and Vidya Balan had earlier been offered the role that went to Konkona Sen Sharma.\\n\"Laaga Chunari Mein Daag\" was Jaya Bachchan\\'s first film since Nikhil Advani\\'s \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" (2003).\\nThe production of the film gathered some controversy when a lighting crew-member drowned in the Ganges River. During a shooting session in Varanasi, Mukherji\\'s bodyguards aggressively moved media people and fans away from the film set. A political and media storm followed, as various groups insisted that Mukherji should have stopped the security guards. The actress then apologised to the media, though claiming the media were trying to get too close to both her and Sen Sharma. Some scenes involving Mukherji and Bachchan were shot in Bern, Switzerland and Lucerne, Switzerland.\\nMusic.\\nThe film\\'s soundtrack was released on 10 September 2007.

The film opened well as it was highly anticipated. However, due to negative reviews as well as the competition it faced from the more-successful \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\", it proved to be a box office dud in India. However, it was more successful overseas.\\nIn an interview with the filmmaker Pradeep Sarkar, said: \"It was a tight budget film made with 150\\xa0million and already on the first week it has made 250\\xa0million gross worldwide. In what way we are saying that it is not doing well?\" asked Sarkar. \"Admitting that the film did take a slow start in the domestic market, he\\'s hopeful it will grow on audiences in the weeks ahead, much in the same way that his debut film \"Parineeta\" (2005) did. \"\\nIn India, the film received a generally negative critical response, with reviewers criticizing the repetitious and obsolete story line.

Indian cinema threw off the \"dupatta\" just a little while ago; let\\'s not shackle it back down\". Taran Adarsh from \"indiaFM\" said it \"stands on a shaky script and has all chances of slipping\". Martin D\\'Souza of \"Glamsham.com\" noted, \"this is a big letdown\" from the director of the well-received \"Parineeta\" (2005). The \"Hindustan Times\" wrote that, \"This one comes out smelling of mothballs, like a wedding dress stored for decades in an attic trunk.

Anupama Chopra found the film \"a cauldron of wonderful cinematic talent, undone by half-baked writing\".\\nCritical response in the United States to the film was more mixed. Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\" said that the film put \"glossy Bollywood confection\" in a historical context, calling it a \"good old-fashioned, Douglas Sirk-style women\\'s weepie ... so universal you could substitute Joan Crawford for Rani Mukherji and New York City for Mumbai\". Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" found the film \"breaks no new ground but is solidly entertaining\" while David Chute of \"L.A.

It was fought between a combined Habsburg-Transylvanian force and the Ottoman Empire near the village of Mezőkeresztes () in modern-day northern Hungary. The Ottomans routed the Habsburg-led army but Ottoman casualties were too high for them to pursue.\\nBackground.\\nOn 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from Constantinopole. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe (now known as Plovdiv), Sofia, and Niš to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger (Erlau). The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against Ottoman suzerainty.\\nHowever, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had brutally killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege of the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As retaliation for the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of the castle were all executed.\\nNot long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman army should march out of Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, plus 15 other European countries for a total of 55,000 men.\\nBattle.\\nThe Ottoman army marched through several passageways of marshy terrain and reached Haçova (Turkish meaning: Plain of the Cross), exhausted after a long siege and a hard, long march. The two armies faced each other on the plains of Haçova (). The Austrian-Transylvanian army, under the joint command of Archduke Maximillian III of Austria and Prince Sigismund Bathory of Transylvania, was in position in fortified trenches. When the Ottoman army attacked the Austrian trenches, the Battle of Haçova commenced and continued for two days, from 25–26 October 1596. Early firearms (cannons, muskets) were used extensively in the battle. The Austrians, being entrenched around the old ruined church, succeeded in driving back the Ottoman assaults with a barrage of fire from muskets and 100 cannon.\\nBy the second day of battle the Ottoman army appeared to have been defeated. According to the 17th Century Ottoman historian İbrahim Peçevi:\\n\"The Christians broke through the Ottoman army, but the soldiers of the Islam had not yet felt the defeat. Then, they started to plunder and taking of booty at the command headquarters of the Ottomans. Under a few flags, a large group of Christian soldiers attacked the tent where the chests of gold money of the Ottoman Exchequer were kept. They killed and otherwise eliminated the Janissary and household cavalry soldiers guarding the State Treasury. The Christian soldiers got on the Treasury chests of gold coin and put up their flags of cross over them and started to dance around them.\"\\nCommander Sultan Mehmed III wanted to flee from the battlefield. However, first he asked for the opinion of his tutor, the high cleric Hoca Sadeddin Efendi, who told the Sultan that he should continue the battle till the end. Heeding this advice, Sultan Mehmed III ordered that the battle should continue.\\nOn the second day of the battle, the fighting intensified. Troops from the Austrian army had reached the Sultan\\'s tent, which was surrounded by the viziers and the teachers at the Palace Pages School for protection. While some troops were trying to enter the Sultan\\'s tent, the other Austrian army\\'s soldiers disengaged, in search of booty and plunder instead of continuing the engagement. The Ottoman horse groomers, cooks, tent makers, and camels minders retaliated against the plunderers with whatever arms they could find, including cooks\\' spoons, blocks of wood, hammers for tent making, adzes, and axes for cutting wood. The Austrians were surprised and retreated in confusion. The cries of \"the Christian enemy is fleeing\" were heard by the Ottoman troops still fighting what seemed like a losing battle on the frontline. The boost of morale allowed them to recover the battle. With a major action from the artillery, the Ottoman forces started another attack on the Austrians across the front and outflanked the Austrian-Transylvanian army, routing them.\\nAftermath.\\nSoon after victory, Mehmed III appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the new Grand Vizier. He sent an imperial victory proclamation to Istanbul giving the news of the conquering of Eger (Erlau) Castle and the victory at the Battle of Haçova (Keresztes). This reached Istanbul in October and there were public celebrations and public meetings organized in the city. During these celebrations, four galleys full of state-procured sugar from Egypt arrived at Istanbul harbor, which added \"sweetness\" to the news of a military victory. Mehmed III was awarded the epithet of \\'Conqueror of Egri\\'.\\nThe Sultan\\'s army marched for a month, returning to Istanbul victorious. With the army in place, a great victory procession and many accompanying spectacles were carried out. The poets of Istanbul wrote special works about the victory. In the streets and markets of the city, town-criers were sent to announce that the streets of the city would be decorated. The warehouses and stores were all decorated with \\'valuable cloths\\'. This display of colour all across the city is described in a poem by the poet [Kemal]:\\n\"All the shops of the city became colored due to conquerors wishes&lt;br&gt;\\nEach of which were decorated as if it were the kerchief of the sweetheart”\\nCasualties.\\nThe Christians lost 12,000, 23,000 or 30,000 men, while the Ottomans suffered 20,000–30,000 casualties.'),\n ('8034113',\n  'Trudo',\n  'Saint Trudo (Tron, Trond, Trudon, Trutjen, Truyen) (died ca. 698) was a saint of the seventh century.

Here he received his education at the Church of St. Stephen, to which he always showed a strong affection and donated his later foundation. After his ordination he returned to his native district, preached the Gospel, and built a church at \"Sarchinium\", on the River Cicindria.

It was collected under both the Old Poor Law and the New Poor Law. It was absorbed into 'general rate' local taxation in the 1920s, and has continuity with the currently existing Council Tax.\\nIntroduction.\\nThe Poor Relief Act 1601 consolidated earlier poor relief legislation and introduced a system of rating property. The introduction of the poor rate required the authorities, known as a vestry, in each parish to meet once a year to set the poor rate and to appoint an overseer of the poor to collect the rate. The justices of the peace at the quarter sessions had a role in checking the accounts of the poor rate.\\nReform.\\nThe system of rating was subject to reform, such as excluding property outside of the parish a rate was paid. Because the poor rate was collected and spent locally within a single parish the notion of settlement was confirmed by the Poor Relief Act 1662 to exclude the poor from other parishes.\\nThe Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 removed responsibility for collection of the poor rate from the parish vestries. The collection of poor rate continued to be organised by parish, now collected by the poor law guardians for the parish. Although parishes were often grouped into unions, each parish could be set a different rate depending on the expenditure.\\nDuring the 19th century a number of anomalies in the parish system, for example where parishes were divided into chapelries each acting much like a distinct parish, were corrected. The criteria used by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 for areas that should form civil parishes was that they set their own poor rate.\\nLondon.\\nThe Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 established a metropolitan poor rate to be collected across the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The London (Equalisation of Rates) Act 1894 provided that richer parishes in what was now the County of London would subsidise the poor rate of the less wealthy that had higher expenditure.\\nAbolition.\\nThe system of rating for the poor rate was used as the basis of other rates, such as the general county rate from 1738.\\nThe separate poor rate was amalgamated with the local district or borough general rate by the Rating and Valuation Act 1925.

He had his Norwegian break through with the album \"Ta meg med\" in 1981, receiving an Spellemannpris in 1982.'),\n ('8034168',\n  'Arkady Severny',\n  'Arkady Dmitriyevich Severny (né Zvyodzin; 12 March 1939 – 12 April 1980) was a Soviet Russian folk singer. He was very popular in the Soviet Union in the 1970s, primarily because of his criminal songs. He sang more than 1,000 songs based on criminal folklore and literature. Severny worked with well-known Russian jazz and restaurant musicians. He recorded more than 80 albums, both solo and orchestral.\\nEarly life.\\nArkady Dmitriyevich Zvyozdin was born in the town of Ivanovo, near Moscow. Contrary to popular belief, in his childhood years he was neither a hooligan nor a poor pupil. He belonged to the so-called \"golden youth\", with his father occupying a senior position on the Ivanovo railroad. The young Arkady did well at school, and loved to play the seven-string guitar. Owing to a near-eidetic memory, he could perform a large number of songs. His older sister once gave him a thick copybook filled with song lyrics, including numerous prison songs; he quickly learned this peculiar repertoire and eagerly sang such songs in polite company.\\nAfter graduating from school in 1957, Severny left for Leningrad, where he enrolled in the S.M. Kirov Forestry Academy, and participated in amateur musical and theatrical productions, including student ensembles that wrote and performed their own songs written in English in the style of Louis Armstrong. Having become completely engrossed in student amateur art, he did not study very diligently and after each term was on the verge of being expelled. Finally, he had to discontinue his studies for a while and took an academic leave of absence.\\nFirst recordings.\\nOnce, in the company of friends, Severny sang about a dozen songs, which he recorded on tape. In 1963, his first recordings, with a total recording time of 35–40 minutes, were released. Upon receiving his degree in 1965, he was given an administrative job at SoyuzEksportLes (Wood Export Union). Nevertheless, working in an office environment was of little interest to him; he wanted to sing. In the summer of 1967, Severny became acquainted with one Rudolf Fuchs, a person who recorded singers and songwriters who played the guitar. Fuchs had the idea of producing the novice\\'s first album in the form of a refined hoax, specifically a non-existent radio program, which was allegedly broadcast on the Soviet airwaves. Severny performed prison songs on the radio at the request of the program\\'s listening audience. The fake radio program turned out to be a major success, due to the provocative nature of the songs that were allegedly performed on Soviet radio.\\nThe pseudonym Severny was adopted as a matter of style. In the 1960s, many of the Soviet Union\\'s Gulags were located in the north of Russia. Severny, being the Russian word for \"northern\", fit Severny\\'s carefully cultivated image as a prison singer perfectly. Secondly, the pseudonym served as a cover, since in those years one could actually be sent to prison for giving underground concerts.\\nPopularity.\\nIn 1968, Severny was discharged from the Soviet Army, where he had served as lieutenant for a year in a helicopter regiment not far from Leningrad. Having demobilized, the singer learned that during the period of his mandatory service, his popularity as a singer had grown considerably. He then received an invitation from producer Sergei Maklakov. Severny performed his songs throughout an entire evening at Maklakov\\'s residence, resulting in 500 meters of recordings on the now outdated reel-to-reel tape recorder that were quickly disseminated throughout the entire Soviet Union and eventually gave rise to the popularity of the performer\\'s prison songs. It was with great pleasure that music lovers all over the country listened to the singer\\'s slightly hoarse voice performing such revived songs as \"Roast Chicken\", \"School of Ballet Dance\", \"I Lived in Noisy Odessa\", \"Mother, I’m In Love With A Pilot\", \"Tram #10 Passed By\", and many others. During the recording, Severny would shout interjections such as \"In Odessa-\"\"\", \"Back when I was in Odessa-\", and other similar lyrics, mimicking the style found in the city of Odessa, known for its criminal culture. This, too, was part of his carefully cultivated image. Indeed, many of Severny\\'s listeners actually believed that he was from Odessa.\\nDeath.\\nOn 12 April 1980, Severny died from a massive intracerebral hemorrhage while staying at a friend\\'s house in Leningrad. Due to circumstances which are not entirely clear, the urn containing his ashes disappeared before burial could take place. Therefore, his \"tomb\" in Saint Petersburg is in fact a cenotaph.\\nLegacy.\\nSeverny managed to combine and concentrate practically the entire international lexicon of the \"prison song\" genre. Moreover, although it was understood that Severny himself performed as a character, and was not himself a criminal, the genre remained one of the most prominent in the 1970s and 1980s underground scene.\\nIt should also be noted that the official culture of the Soviet \"stagnation\" period not only had as its foil the light non-conformism coming from the direction of the intelligentsia, but also the dark culture of the Soviet criminal underworld. Because Severny was not recognized by the authorities as a singer, he became a cult figure in the Soviet Union, with the population clamouring to get recordings of his underground concerts. Russian criminal culture thus became an essential integral part of the greater Russian culture.'),\n ('8034192', 'Moelven', 'Moelv, Moelven, or Moelva may refer to:'),\n ('8034196',\n  'Terry Zahn',\n  'Terry Alan Zahn (April 27, 1946 – January 25, 2000) was a television reporter and anchorman in Hampton Roads, Virginia, from 1981 until his death in 2000 from multiple myeloma (a type of bone cancer).\\nBiography.\\nZahn was Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 27, 1946.

From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek and Roman mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are Botticelli\\'s \"Birth of Venus\" and \"Pallas and the Centaur\", the \"Ledas\" of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, and Raphael\\'s \"Galatea\". Through the medium of Latin and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy.\\nIn northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, Chaucer, the Elizabethans and John Milton were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from Shakespeare to Robert Bridges turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. Jean Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama. Racine reworked the ancient myths — including those of Phaidra, Andromache, Oedipus and Iphigeneia — to new purpose.\\nIn the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the Enlightenment spread throughout Europe. It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for Handel\\'s operas \"Admeto\" and \"Semele\", Mozart\\'s \"Idomeneo\", and Gluck\\'s \"Iphigénie en Aulide\". By the end of the century, Romanticism initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer\\'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as Keats, Byron, and Shelley. The Hellenism of Queen Victoria\\'s poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of King Arthur are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the Parthenon marbles in 1816; many of the \"Greek\" paintings of Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.\\nAmerican authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature. According to Bulfinch, \"The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste.\" In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O\\'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish James Joyce and the French André Gide. Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others have set Greek mythological themes to music.'),\n ('8034210',\n  'Rubus deliciosus',\n  'Rubus deliciosus is a North American species of flowering plant in the rose family Rosaceae, native to the United States.

The FDA allows 46 different chemicals under the umbrella of \"gum base.\" The chemicals are posted on their website. These chemicals are grouped into the following categories.\\nGum bases for chewing gum are different from those for bubble gum. A bubble gum base is formulated with the ability to blow bubbles; it contains higher levels of elastomers or higher molecular weight polymers for this purpose.

Cosmetic body art is argued to have been the earliest form of a ritual in human culture. The evidence for this comes in the form of utilised red mineral pigments (red ochre) including crayons associated with the emergence of \"Homo sapiens\" in Africa. Cosmetics are mentioned in the Old Testament—2 Kings 9:30 where Jezebel painted her eyelids—approximately 840 BC—and the book of Esther describes various beauty treatments as well.\\nCosmetics were also used in ancient Rome, although much of Roman literature suggests that it was frowned upon. It is known that some women in ancient Rome invented make up including lead-based formulas, to whiten the skin, and kohl to line the eyes.\\nAcross the globe.\\nNorth Africa.\\nEgypt.\\nOne of the earliest cultures to use cosmetics was ancient Egypt, where both Egyptian men and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. The use of cosmetics in Ancient Egypt is well documented. Kohl has its roots in north Africa. The use of black kohl eyeliner and eyeshadows in dark colours such as blue, red, and black was common, and was commonly recorded and represented in Egyptian art, as well as being seen in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Ancient Egyptians also extracted red dye from fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some bromine mannite, but this dye resulted in serious illness. Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a pearlescent substance found in fish scales, which are still used extensively today. Despite the hazardous nature of some Egyptian cosmetics, ancient Egyptian makeup was also thought to have antibacterial properties that helped prevent infections. Remedies to treat wrinkles contained ingredients such as gum of frankincense and fresh moringa. For scars and burns, a special ointment was made of red ochre, kohl, and sycamore juice. An alternative treatment was a poultice of carob grounds and honey, or an ointment made of knotgrass and powdered root of wormwood. To improve breath the ancient Egyptians chewed herbs or frankincense which is still in use today. Jars of what could be compared with setting lotion have been found to contain a mixture of beeswax and resin. These doubled as remedies for problems such as baldness and greying hair. They also used these products on their mummies, because they believed that it would make them irresistible in the after life.\\nMiddle East.\\nCosmetics are mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in 2 Kings , where the biblical figure Jezebel painted her eyelids (approximately 840 BC). Cosmetics are also mentioned in the book of Esther, where beauty treatments are described.\\nAsia.\\nChina.\\nFlowers play an important decorative role in China. Legend has it that once on the 7th day of the 1st lunar month, while Princess Shouyang, daughter of Emperor Wu of Liu Song, was resting under the eaves of Hanzhang Palace near the plum trees after wandering in the gardens, a plum blossom drifted down onto her fair face, leaving a floral imprint on her forehead that enhanced her beauty further. The court ladies were said to be so impressed, that they started decorating their own foreheads with a small delicate plum blossom design. This is also the mythical origin of the floral fashion, \"meihua zhuang\" (梅花妝; literally \"plum blossom makeup\"), that originated in the Southern Dynasties (420–589) and became popular amongst ladies in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties.\\nMongolia.\\nWomen of royal families painted red spots on the center of their cheeks, right under their eyes. However, it is a mystery why. They said that red cheeks are a reason of happy queen. \\nJapan.\\nIn Japan, geisha wore lipstick made of crushed safflower petals to paint the eyebrows and edges of the eyes as well as the lips, and sticks of \"bintsuke\" wax, a softer version of the sumo wrestlers\\' hair wax, were used by geisha as a makeup base. Rice powder colors the face and back; rouge contours the eye socket and defines the nose. Ohaguro (black paint) colours the teeth for the ceremony, called Erikae, when \"maiko\" (apprentice geisha) graduate and become independent. The geisha would also sometimes use bird droppings to compile a lighter color.\\nWestern Asia.\\nCosmetics were used in Persia and what today is Iran from ancient periods. Kohl is a black powder that is used widely across the Persian Empire. It is used as a powder or smeared to darken the edges of the eyelids similar to eyeliner. After Persian tribes converted to Islam and conquered those areas, in some areas cosmetics were only restricted if they were to disguise the real look in order to mislead or cause uncontrolled desire. In Islamic law, despite these requirements, there is no absolute prohibition on wearing cosmetics; the cosmetics must not be made of substances that harm one\\'s body.\\nAn early teacher in the 10th century was Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, or Abulcasis, who wrote the 24-volume medical encyclopedia \"Al-Tasrif\". A chapter of the 19th volume was dedicated to cosmetics. As the treatise was translated into Latin, the cosmetic chapter was used in the West. Al-Zahrawi considered cosmetics a branch of medicine, which he called \"Medicine of Beauty\" (\"Adwiyat al-Zinah\"). He deals with perfumes, scented aromatics and incense. There were perfumed sticks rolled and pressed in special molds, perhaps the earliest antecedents of present-day lipsticks and solid deodorants. He also used oily substances called \"Adhan\" for medication and beautification.\\nEurope.\\nCultures to use cosmetics include the ancient Greeks and the Romans. In the Roman Empire, the use of cosmetics was common amongst prostitutes and rich women. Such adornment was sometimes lamented by certain Roman writers, who thought it to be against the \"castitas\" required of women by what they considered traditional Roman values; and later by Christian writers who expressed similar sentiments in a slightly different context. Pliny the Elder mentioned cosmetics in his \"Naturalis Historia\", and Ovid wrote a book on the topic.\\nPale faces were a trend during the European Middle Ages. In the 16th century, women would bleed themselves to achieve pale skin. Spanish prostitutes wore pink makeup to contrast pale skin. 13th century Italian women wore red lipstick to show that they were upper class. Use of cosmetics continued in Middle Ages, where the face was whitened and the cheeks rouged; during the later 16th century in the West, the personal attributes of the women who used makeup created a demand for the product among the upper class. Cosmetics continued to be used in the following centuries, though attitudes towards cosmetics varied throughout time, with the use of cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points in Western history. In the 19th century, Queen Victoria publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors, with many famous actresses of the time, such as Sarah Bernhardt and Lillie Langtry using makeup.\\n19th-century fashion ideals of women appearing delicate, feminine and pale were achieved by some through the use of makeup, with some women discreetly using rouge on their cheeks and drops of \"belladonna\" to dilate their eyes to appear larger. Though cosmetics were used discreetly by many women, makeup in Western cultures during this time was generally frowned upon, particularly during the 1870s, when Western social etiquette increased in rigidity. Teachers and clergy were specifically forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\\nAmericas and Australia.\\nSome Native American tribes painted their faces for ceremonial events or battle. Similar practices were followed by Aboriginals in Australia.\\n19th century.\\nDuring the late 1800s, the Western cosmetics industry began to grow due to a rise in “visual self-awareness,” a shift in the perception of color cosmetics, and improvements in the safety of products. Prior to the 19th century, limitations in lighting technology and access to reflective devices stifled people’s ability to regularly perceive their appearance. This, in turn, limited the need for a cosmetic market and resulted in individuals creating and applying their own products at home. Several technological advancements in the latter half of the century, including the innovation of mirrors, commercial photography, marketing and electricity in the home and in public, increased consciousness of one’s appearance and created a demand for cosmetic products that improved one’s image.\\nFace powders, rouges, lipstick and similar products made from home were found to have toxic ingredients, which deterred customers from their use. Discoveries of non-toxic cosmetic ingredients, such as Henry Tetlow’s 1866 use of zinc oxide as a face powder, and the distribution of cosmetic products by established companies such as Rimmel, Guerlain, and Hudnut helped popularize cosmetics to the broader public. Skincare, along with “face painting” products like powders, also became in-demand products of the cosmetics industry. The mass advertisements of cold cream brands such as Pond’s through billboards, magazines, and newspapers created a high demand for the product. These advertisement and cosmetic marketing styles were soon replicated in European countries, which further increased the popularity of the advertised products in Europe.\\n20th century.\\nDuring the early 1900s, makeup was not excessively popular. In fact, women hardly wore makeup at all. Make-up at this time was still mostly the territory of prostitutes, those in cabarets and on the black &amp; white screen. Face enameling (applying actual paint to the face) became popular among the rich at this time in an attempt to look paler. This practice was dangerous due to the main ingredient often being arsenic. Pale skin was associated with wealth because it meant that one was not out working in the sun and could afford to stay inside all day. Cosmetics were so unpopular that they could not be bought in department stores; they could only be bought at theatrical costume stores. A woman\\'s \"makeup routine\" often only consisted of using papier poudré, a powdered paper/oil blotting sheet, to whiten the nose in the winter and shine their cheeks in the summer. Rouge was considered provocative, so was only seen on \"women of the night.\" Some women used burnt matchsticks to darken eyelashes, and geranium and poppy petals to stain the lips. Vaseline became high in demand because it was used on chapped lips, as a base for hair tonic, and soap. Toilet waters were introduced in the early 1900s, but only lavender water or refined cologne was admissible for women to wear. Cosmetic deodorant was invented in 1888, by an unknown inventor from Philadelphia and was trademarked under the name \"Mum\". Roll-on deodorant was launched in 1952, and aerosol deodorant in 1965.\\nAround 1910, make-up became fashionable in the United States of America and Europe owing to the influence of ballet and theatre stars such as Mathilde Kschessinska and Sarah Bernhardt. Colored makeup was introduced in Paris upon the arrival of the Russian Ballet in 1910, where ochers and crimsons were the most typical shades. The \"Daily Mirror\" beauty book showed that cosmetics were now acceptable for the literate classes to wear. With that said, men often saw rouge as a mark of sex and sin, and rouging was considered an admission of ugliness. In 1915, a Kansas legislature proposed to make it a misdemeanor for women under the age of forty-four to wear cosmetics \"for the purpose of creating a false impression.\" The \"Daily Mirror\" was one of the first to suggest using a pencil line (eyeliner) to elongate the eye and an eyelash curler to accentuate the lashes. Eyebrow darkener was also presented in this beauty book, created from gum Arabic, Indian ink, and rosewater. George Burchett developed cosmetic tattooing during this time period. He was able to tattoo on pink blushes, red lips, and dark eyebrows. He also was able to tattoo men disfigured in the First World War by inserting skin tones in damaged faces and by covering scars with colors more pleasing to the eye. Max Factor opened up a professional makeup studio for stage and screen actors in Los Angeles in 1909. Even though his store was intended for actors, ordinary women came in to purchase theatrical eye shadow and eyebrow pencils for their home use.\\nIn the 1920s, the film industry in Hollywood had the most influential impact on cosmetics. Stars such as Theda Bara had a substantial effect on the makeup industry. Helena Rubinstein was Bara\\'s makeup artist; she created mascara for the actress, relying on her experiments with kohl. Others who saw the opportunity for the mass-market of cosmetics during this time were Max Factor, Sr., and Elizabeth Arden. Many of the present day makeup manufacturers were established during the 1920s and 1930s. Lipsticks were one of the most popular cosmetics of this time, more so than rouge and powder, because they were colorful and cheap. In 1915, Maurice Levy invented the metal container for lipstick, which gave license to its mass production. The Flapper style also influenced the cosmetics of the 1920s, which embraced dark eyes, red lipstick, red nail polish, and the suntan, invented as a fashion statement by Coco Chanel. The eyebrow pencil became vastly popular in the 1920s, in part because it was technologically superior to what it had been, due to a new ingredient: hydrogenated cottonseed oil (also the key constituent of another wonder product of that era Crisco Oil). The early commercial mascaras, like Maybelline, were simply pressed cakes containing soap and pigments. A woman would dip a tiny brush into hot water, rub the bristles on the cake, remove the excess by rolling the brush onto some blotting paper or a sponge, and then apply the mascara as if her eyelashes were a watercolor canvas. Eugène Schueller, founder of L\\'Oréal, invented modern synthetic hair dye in 1907 and he also invented sunscreen in 1936. The first patent for a nail polish was granted in 1919. Its color was a very faint pink. It\\'s not clear how dark this rose was, but any girl whose nails were tipped in any pink darker than a baby\\'s blush risked gossip about being \"fast.\" Previously, only agricultural workers had sported suntans, while fashionable women kept their skins as pale as possible. In the wake of Chanel\\'s adoption of the suntan, dozens of new fake tan products were produced to help both men and women achieve the \"sun-kissed\" look. In Asia, skin whitening continued to represent the ideal of beauty, as it does to this day.\\nIn the time period after the First World War, there was a boom in cosmetic surgery. During the 1920s and 1930s, facial configuration and social identity dominated a plastic surgeon\\'s world. Face-lifts were performed as early as 1920, but it wasn\\'t until the 1960s when cosmetic surgery was used to reduce the signs of aging. During the twentieth century, cosmetic surgery mainly revolved around women. Men only participated in the practice if they had been disfigured by the war. Silicone implants were introduced in 1962. In the 1980s, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons made efforts to increase public awareness about plastic surgery. As a result, in 1982, the United States Supreme Court granted physicians the legal right to advertise their procedures. The optimistic and simplified nature of narrative advertisements often made the surgeries seem hazard-free, even though they were anything but. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reported that more than two million Americans elected to undergo cosmetic procedures, both surgical and non-surgical, in 1998, liposuction being the most popular. Breast augmentations ranked second, while numbers three, four, and five went to eye surgery, face-lifts, and chemical peels.\\nDuring the 1920s, numerous African Americans participated in skin bleaching in an attempt to lighten their complexion as well as hair straightening to appear whiter. Skin bleaches and hair straighteners created fortunes worth millions and accounted for a massive thirty to fifty percent of all advertisements in the black press of the decade. Oftentimes, these bleaches and straighteners were created and marketed by African American women themselves. Skin bleaches contained caustic chemicals such as hydroquinone, which suppressed the production of melanin in the skin. These bleaches could cause severe dermatitis and even death in high dosages. Many times these regimens were used daily, increasing an individual\\'s risk. In the 1970s, at least five companies started producing make-up for African American women. Before the 1970s, makeup shades for Black women were limited. Face makeup and lipstick did not work for dark skin types because they were created for pale skin tones. These cosmetics that were created for pale skin tones only made dark skin appear grey. Eventually, makeup companies created makeup that worked for richer skin tones, such as foundations and powders that provided a natural match. Popular companies like Astarté, Afram, Libra, Flori Roberts and Fashion Fair priced the cosmetics reasonably due to the fact that they wanted to reach out to the masses.\\nFrom 1939 to 1945, during the Second World War, cosmetics were in short supply. Petroleum and alcohol, basic ingredients of many cosmetics, were diverted into war supply. Ironically, at this time when they were restricted, lipstick, powder, and face cream were most desirable and most experimentation was carried out for the post war period. Cosmetic developers realized that the war would result in a phenomenal boom afterwards, so they began preparing. Yardley, Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and the French manufacturing company became associated with \"quality\" after the war because they were the oldest established. Pond\\'s had this same appeal in the lower price range. Gala cosmetics were one of the first to give its products fantasy names, such as the lipsticks in \"lantern red\" and \"sea coral.\"\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, many women in the western world influenced by feminism decided to go without any cosmetics. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can.\" This included cosmetics, which were among items the protestors called \"instruments of female torture\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity.\\nCosmetics in the 1970s were divided into a \"natural look\" for day and a more sexualized image for evening. Non-allergic makeup appeared when the bare face was in fashion as women became more interested in the chemical value of their makeup. Modern developments in technology, such as the High-shear mixer facilitated the production of cosmetics which were more natural looking and had greater staying power in wear than their predecessors. The prime cosmetic of the time was eye shadow, though; women also were interested in new lipstick colors such as lilac, green, and silver.

Concealer is commonly used by cosmetic-conscious men. Cosmetics brands are releasing cosmetic products especially tailored for men, and men are using such products more commonly. There is some controversy over this, however, as many feel that men who wear makeup are neglecting traditional gender roles, and do not view men wearing cosmetics in a positive light. Others, however, view this as a sign of increasing gender equality and feel that men also have the right to enhance their facial features with cosmetics if women do.\\nToday the market of cosmetics has a different dynamic compared to the 20th century. Some countries are driving this economy:\\nWith the imposition of lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent wariness to return to salons, trends that imitate salon procedures started to emerge, such as more complicated home skin-care regimens, hair color preserving products, and beauty tools.

He was one of the first \"magisters\", recognised masters of theology.\\nLife.\\nHe engaged in a controversy with Wenrich of Trier, taking the papal side in the era of the Investiture Controversy. He also attacked Wolfhelm of Brauweiler.\\nTowards the end of his life (1094) he was a reformer at the religious community at Marbach.\\nWritings.\\nHis \"Ad Gebehardum liber\" of 1085 was a comprehensive discussion of kingship, original and much commented on, and clarifying some of the political arguments most centrally used by the papal supporters; it argued that kingship was an office from which the king could be deposed; his functionalist analogy was with the position of swineherd, held at the pleasure of the employer. This work, dedicated to Gebhard, archbishop of Salzburg, was intended to refute a polemic letter of Wenrich on behalf of Emperor Henry IV, written c.1080-1. A strong supporter of Pope Gregory VII, and the Gregorian revolutionary reforms, Manegold shared with others of his time the view in political thought that secular rulers held their power on the basis of some kind of pact with the ruled. Further, when the pact could be considered broken, the oath of allegiance could be considered null, a theory of resistance adapted to aristocratic arguments that had not long previously been topical in Saxony; this theory had been documented in the 1082 \"Bellum Saxonicum\" of Bruno of Merseburg. The argument that in the past bad kings had frequently been deposed, typically with papal involvement, derived from a papal letter of 1075 to Hermann, bishop of Metz.\\nManegold\\'s book also contained an account of the life of Gregory VII, reflecting the \"Vita\" by John the Deacon of Gregory the Great; this shares details with chronicles of Berthold of Reichenau and Bernold of St Blasien, writing in the part of southern Germany in which Manegold had sheltered after having to leave Alsace. Manegold\\'s sources included St Paul, Jerome, Peter Damian and Bernold; also Pseudo-Chrysostom\\'s \"Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum\", for the way the \\'pact\\' theory was expressed. Along with others arguing from the same side, he used arguments from Cyprian, \"De unitate ecclesiae\", in a version (of the fourth chapter) supporting papal primacy.\\nHe opposed the uncritical acceptance by Christians of the views of pagan classical writers. He was a critic of Macrobius, singling out for attack in geography the spherical earth theory of four isolated continents of Crates of Mallus, on theological grounds.\\nReferences.\\nI. S.

Alternatively it can be defined as “sustainability-oriented product development activities within the scope of one to several product life cycles.” LCE requires analysis to quantify sustainability, setting appropriate targets for environmental impact. The application of complementary methodologies and technologies enables engineers to apply LCE to fulfill environmental objectives.\\nLCE was first introduced in the 1980s as a bottom-up engineering approach, and widely adopted in the 1990s as a systematic ‘cradle-to-grave’ approach. The goal of LCE is to find the best possible compromise in product engineering to meet the needs of society while minimizing environmental impacts. \\xa0The methodology is closely related to, and overlaps with, life-cycle assessment (LCA) to assess environmental impacts; and life cycle costing (LCC) to assess economic impacts.\\nThe product life cycle is formally defined by ISO 14040 as the “consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources to final disposal.” Comprehensive life cycle analysis considers both upstream and downstream processes. Upstream processes include \"the extraction and production of raw materials and manufacturing,\" and downstream processes include product disposal (such as recycling or sending waste to landfill). LCE aims to reduce the negative consequences of consumption and ensure a good quality standard of living for future generations, by reducing waste and making product development and engineering processes more efficient and sustainable.\\nQuantifying environmental sustainability.\\nThe first step in completing LCA or LCE is determining the appropriate sustainability thresholds to use as environmental targets for the product system. The proposed Lyngby framework for LCE is a combined top-down and bottom-up approach for LCE that uses targets based on planetary boundaries. Planetary boundaries can be used to establish limits for the earth’s carrying capacity, defining upper thresholds for the environmental system.\\nThe IPAT equation [Impact = Population (or Volume) x Affluence (or Consumption) x Technology (or Consumption per Unit Produced)] is an accepted method for quantifying the impact of consumption. LCE can be leveraged to manage total environmental impact by addressing the technology effect (single product and product life cycle) and the volume effect (anticipated volume growth as consumption and population increase) of product engineering. Impacts are considered within the context of technical boundary conditions to verify the feasibility of proposed solutions.\\nComplementary methodologies and technologies.\\nModern technology provides innovative new opportunities for LCE:\\nKey themes in life cycle engineering.\\nKey themes in LCE are economic, social, environmental and technological. These themes are interlinking and can be influenced by life cycle engineering.\\nConcluding paragraph of an earlier article on life cycle assessment (ref : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment)\\nLife Cycle Engineering of Material in Service “plays a significant role in saving energy,[1] conserving resources [2] and saving billions by preventing premature[2] failure of critical engineered component in a machine or equipment.

He was elected as a Republican to that seat in a highly contested election against Democrat Gordon Maag in 2004. He was sworn into office on December 6, 2000. \\nKaramier narrowly succeeded in his 2014 retention election. He received 60.77% support for retention. Had he received less than 60% he would have lost retention, which would have made him only the second Illinois judge since 1994 to lose a retention election (and the first since 2004).\\nChief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.\\nKarmeier became 120th chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court on October 31, 2016, and was sworn in by Rita Garman, who herself had served as chief justice. According to \"Herald and Review\", \"In his position, which he\\'ll fill for three years after being elected by his fellow justices on the seven-member court, Karmeier will serve as the top administrator for Illinois\\' judicial system, which includes more than 900 judges.\" According to \"Illinois Lawyer Now\", \"Among other duties, the Chief Justice controls and schedules the Supreme Court\\'s agenda for consideration in conference by the Court during its five formal terms each year, supervises all appointments to Supreme Court committees, serves as chairperson of the Executive Committee of the constitutionally-mandated Illinois Judicial Conference and presents the Court\\'s annual budget request to the General Assembly.\" His term as chief justice ended October 25, 2019.\\nControversies.\\nState Farm Insurance appeal.\\nDuring his candidacy for the office of judge in Illinois, Karmeier managed to raise $4.8 million for his election campaign. This included a direct contribution of $350,000 from the State Farm Insurance group. Other affiliates of State Farm Insurance also paid for Karmeier\\'s campaign. Around that time State Farm policyholders had won $1 billion against State Farm in \"Avery v. State Farm\", and had prevailed at the intermediate appellate court. The appeal against the damages and award was pending before the Illinois Supreme Court. When Karmeier was elected, the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" newspaper published an editorial, \"Big business won a nice return on a $4.3 million investment ... It now has a friendly justice\". Despite opposition, Karmeier refused to dissociate himself from the case, and the appeal was decided in favor of State Farm Insurance by a majority of 4-2, with Karmeier in the majority. $600 million of punitive damages as well as the award of $457 million against State Farm were reversed. In 2018, State Farm agreed to pay a $250 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit claiming State Farm conspired to defraud 4.7 million current and former customers out of the $1.05 billion award.\\nIn 2014, Karmeier was up for a retention vote. A political group of trial lawyers funded a last-minute, $2 million advertising campaign in an unsuccessful effort to unseat him.\\nKarmeier addressed the controversies in a 2014 filing in the Philip Morris case, in which he wrote, \"When I ran for this office a decade ago, I made only one promise.

Its member denominations on the whole could be considered more liberal than the member denominations of the International Conference of Reformed Churches or the World Reformed Fellowship, which are also large ecumenical Calvinist organizations.\\nHistory.\\nThe WCRC traces its origins to 1875, with several unifying Reformed organizations emerging in London, England.\\nAfter a two-day meeting ending on 1 February 2006, Douwe Visser, president of the Reformed Ecumenical Council, and Clifton Kirkpatrick, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, said in a joint letter to their constituencies, \"We rejoice in the work of the Holy Spirit which we believe has led us to recommend that the time has come to bring together the work of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Reformed Ecumenical Council into one body that will strengthen the unity and witness of Calvinist Christians.\"\\nAfter first calling the potential body \"World Reformed Communion\", this was modified into \"World Communion of Reformed Churches\".\\nA Uniting General Council of the WCRC, bringing the organization into existence, took place from 18–26 June 2010 at Calvin College, located at Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States. The council focused on the \"Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace\" mentioned in Ephesians as its main theme, setting a tone of true mutual understanding and acceptance amongst member churches and associates, laying aside differences and other issues as they embark on this shared journey with one another as each seeks to discern the will of God and continue their struggle for justice and peace in the world.\\nWork.\\nThe 2010 Uniting General Council stated that the WCRC should be \"called to communion and committed to justice.\" Its two main program offices are thus focused on these aspects, with theological work included with communion. The Theology and Communion office serves as coordinator for official dialogues with other religious organizations, organizes a bi-annual Global Institute of Theology, and brings Calvinist theological scholars together for various discussions. The Justice office promotes economic, ecological and human rights, basing much of its work on the Accra Confession, a statement adopted at the 2004 General Council of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and re-endorsed at the 2010 Uniting General Council.\\nThe WCRC also has a General Secretariat which includes the general secretary\\'s office, the communications office and other organizational responsibilities.

The Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the acceptance of the Association of Knight\\'s Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht—the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)—as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD—Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.\\nThese recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel\\'s book, [\"The Bearers of the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross 1939–1945\"]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had been nominated for the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.\\nListed here are the 118 Knight\\'s Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name starts with \"A\". Fellgiebel himself delisted one and Scherzer has challenged the validity of three more of these listings. The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient\\'s rank at the time the Knight\\'s Cross was awarded.\\nBackground.\\nThe Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (), the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight\\'s Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight\\'s Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () and the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (), based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight\\'s Cross authorized.\\nRecipients.\\nThe Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight\\'s Cross lists for the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight\\'s Cross, one list per grade. Of the 118 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \"A\", nine were later awarded the Knight\\'s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and 11 presentations were made posthumously.

The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 12,199. The township dates back to the West Derby hundred district from the 12th century.\\nHistory.\\nIn the mid 14th century, the manor of Parr was held by William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre. The manor was divided initially by two local families, documented as \"Halsall de Parr\" and the \"de Parr\". The Halsall family were associated with the area for several generations, with second to last being Sir Thomas Parr, the father of Henry VIII\\'s final wife Catherine Parr. The final descendent, Thomas\\'s son, William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton died without an heir meaning the lands were conveyed back to the crown. The family seat was Parr Hall, sited close to where Frodsham Drive is today.\\nParr was a largely wooded area of heath through much of its early history. It was bisected by the Sankey Brook (known locally as The Flash) and bordered Black Brook to the west and the large moss to the south that divided it from Sutton. The area was already a rich source of timber and peat, and shallow pits revealed easily winnable coal and New Red Sandstone just beneath the surface. The area rapidly became dotted with Bell pits. The industrial revolution brought the development of the canals and railways. The largest of such, the Sankey Canal, also known as the Sankey Brook Navigation, opened in 1757, and ran from close to the mouth of Sankey Brook at the River Mersey along the Sankey Valley into the Broad Oak Basin, ending north east of St Helens. Later extensions were made at the Mersey end, firstly to Fiddlers Ferry, then to Widnes, and at the northern end, where it was extended into what became the centre of St Helens.\\nWhen visited in the early 1900\\'s, the historians William Farrer and J Brownbill described Parr as \"a township unpleasing to the eye, where the natural amenities have been replaced by everything unlovely that man could devise\" remarking how all the natural landscape had been given over to industry.

Amidst these estates remain the more traditional buildings dating to the 1930s, along with Terrace Housing (1890s onwards) and private developments.\\nThe area succumbed to social problems linked to poverty and an aging population during the 1980s with the collapse of several significant employers in St. Helens. Its housing remains markedly cheaper than other areas of St. Helens due to a commonly perceived stigma of high crime and low education standards.\\nSince 2006 the area, as well as other areas of St. Helens in coordination with Re:new Neighbourhood Management Project, has been targeted for regeneration. Parr was selected for the Pilot scheme and has seen increased funding to local parks and green spaces (The Duckeries for instance, formerly a slag heap, is now in the process of returning the land to its marshy origins, whilst new multi-sporting facilities and park equipment have been added to Gaskell Park and others).\\nIn coordination with Helena Housing many council and private properties have been refurbished with new exterior walls, adding a new roof to each property, UPVC doors and double glazing.

No article on the rules of etiquette, nor any list of faux pas, can ever be complete. As the perception of behaviors and actions vary, intercultural competence is essential. A lack of knowledge about the customs and expectations of Asian people can make even those with good intentions seem rude, foolish, and disrespectful.\\nAsian etiquette is often manifested with shades of \"respect\", \"good manners\" and \"filial\", and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.\\nBangladesh.\\nBangladeshi society is reserved and very structured. While the norms change or vary, there are timeless customs such as respect for the elders and high regard for family. Old people are always treated with deference and it is considered rude for a young person to be direct and opinionated when talking to elders. Even prolonged eye contact with a senior is considered bad manners. \\nBangladeshis are modest people and it is not recommended to give excessive praise and can be interpreted as insincere and offensive. Religion serves as a strong influence on etiquette. It is not acceptable for a man to shake hands with a woman if the latter did not offer a hand first. Along with social categorization, religion dictates what is allowed and prohibited. \\nWhen it comes to business, the etiquette is similar to those found in other Asian countries such as not being direct when communicating one\\'s position or ideas.\\nBrunei.\\nEtiquette in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.\\nChina.\\nEating is a dominant aspect of Chinese culture and eating out is one of the most common ways to honour guests, socialize, and deepen friendships. Generally, Chinese etiquette is very similar to that in other East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, with some exceptions. In most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared communally. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups. There is a specific seating order to every formal dinner, based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The seat of honour, reserved for the host or oldest person, is usually the one in the center facing east or facing the entrance. Chopsticks are used instead of forks and knives. In most Chinese restaurants, there is no tip required unless it is explicitly posted. Tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. A verbal \"thank you\" (谢谢; \"xiexie\") should be offered to the server pouring the tea.\\nIndia.\\nEtiquette in India shares many similarities with its South and Southeast Asian neighbours, however, there are exceptions found throughout the country.\\nIndonesia.\\nIt is important to understand that Indonesia is a vast tropical country of sprawling archipelago with extremely diverse culture. Each of these Indonesian ethnic groups has its own culture, tradition and may speak its own language. Each of them may adhere to different religions that have their own rules. These combinations made Indonesia a complex mixture of traditions that may differ from one place to another. Indonesia shares many of the points of etiquette with other Southeast Asian nations. As Indonesia has a Muslim majority population, some points of etiquette in the Middle East also apply. Following are some key points of Indonesian etiquette:\\nIt is important to be considerate of other people\\'s dignity. Shaming or humiliating people in public is considered extremely rude.\\nOne should always use their right hand when shaking hands, offering a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, pointing or generally touching another person.\\nJapan.\\nJapanese customs and etiquette can be especially complex and demanding. The knowledge that non-Japanese who commit faux pas act from inexperience can fail to offset the negative emotional response some Japanese people feel when their expectations in matters of etiquette are not met.\\nPakistan.\\nIn urban Sindh and in other parts of the country, men and women usually lower their head and lift their hand to their forehead to make the \"adab\" gesture when greeting each other, instead of a handshake.\\nPhilippines.\\nThree centuries of Spanish and 48 years of American rule, as well as the influence of Japan, China, India, Middle East and the West, have added to the classic indigenous etiquette of the Philippines. It has become a unique and particularly formal sense of etiquette concerning social functions, filial piety and public behaviour.

For this musical work, Verdi utilized the national anthems of several European nations.\\nProduction.\\nIn December 1943, Arturo Toscanini filmed a performance of this music for inclusion in an Office of War Information documentary about the role of Italian-Americans in aiding the Allies during World War II. Toscanini added a bridge passage to include arrangements of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the United States and \"The Internationale\" for the Soviet Union and the Italian partisans. Joining Toscanini in the filmed performance in NBC Studio 8-H, were tenor Jan Peerce, the Westminster Choir, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra.\\nThe film also included the overture to Verdi\\'s opera \"La Forza del Destino\". The narration was written by May Sarton, film editing by Boris Kaufman, and narration read by actor Burgess Meredith. The original version was released on VHS by Blackhawk Films, which retitled it \"Arturo Toscanini Conducts Giuseppe Verdi\". A newly restored version by the Library of Congress, with the Meredith narration, has been issued on DVD.\\nReception.\\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The Academy Film Archive preserved \"Hymn of the Nations\" in 2010. The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives.\\nCensorship.\\nDuring the post-war Red Scare, the US government crudely censored \"The Internationale\" out of the film. The version continued to be released without any acknowledgement of censorship.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services oversees the program\\'s implementation.\\nOrigins.\\nBefore the implementation of the federally-funded State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) initiative, Governor Tommy Thompson had wished to create a state-level family healthcare plan that used both Medicaid and SCHIP funds since his days in the state legislature.\\nBadgerCare was passed in the wake of the Clinton administration\\'s social service overhaul (when Aid to Families with Dependent Children was replaced by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and launched in July 1999. The goal was to provide coverage to families with uninsured children who were transitioning from welfare to the workforce. The program\\'s initial enrollment was 3,400 adolescents, but the total number of individuals covered by BadgerCare increased to 51,172 by November 2000.\\nUnder the original conditions of BadgerCare, families could enroll if their net incomes were up to 185% of the federal poverty level (about $31,000 for a family of four in 2000) and could remain on BadgerCare as long as their incomes did not exceed 200% of the federal poverty level. Unlike Medicaid, a family applying for BadgerCare did not have to pass any sort of \"asset test\" to qualify.\\nDoyle administration (2003-2011).\\nIn 2006, the Democratic-controlled Wisconsin Senate passed a bill nicknamed the \"Healthy Wisconsin proposal\" that would have created a near-universal health care system in Wisconsin similar to the Massachusetts health care reform of 2006 implemented by then-governor Mitt Romney. Like the Massachusetts plan and the Affordable Care Act, the Healthy Wisconsin proposal would have mandated insurance coverage for any individual not on Medicare or BadgerCare. The proposed plan would not cover dental or eye care, long-term care, nor unnecessary cosmetic surgery. The plan was to have been paid for by a $15 billion payroll tax, making it incredibly unpopular among the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Assembly, and Democratic governor Jim Doyle.\\nTransition to BadgerCare+.\\nSince Governor Doyle opposed the Senate\\'s mandate plan, he chose instead to expand BadgerCare, claiming that 98% of Wisconsinites would have some form of health insurance under his expansion. Doyle called the revised program BadgerCare+ and included it in his 2007-2009 biennial budget. BadgerCare+ began functioning on February 1, 2008.\\nAccording to a state document sent to healthcare providers in January 2008, BadgerCare+ expanded enrollment to: \\nThe revised plan also covered tobacco cessation products such as nicotine gum.\\nEnrollment issues and BadgerCare+ Basic.\\nThe extremely high number of applications for the BadgerCare+ Core plan put undue stress on the program\\'s budget, and Doyle suspended enrollments for that program in October 2009 with 21,000 individuals still on the waiting list. To assuage the thousands of Wisconsinites still seeking coverage, Doyle proposed an additional plan named BadgerCare+ Basic, targeted at childless adults. The income stipulations for BadgerCare+ Basic were $21,660 a year for a single childless individual and $29,140 for a childless couple. In contrast to Badgercare+ Core, coverage would be funded by a $130 premium to be paid by the policyholder, rather than taxpayers, and would cover up to 10 doctor visits, one inpatient hospital visit, five outpatient visits, and up to five emergency room visits in addition to some generic medications and discounts on other drugs.

In return for this favour, the monks were asked to present a rose to de Cogan and his descendants on the annual feast day of St. John the Baptist (24 June).\\nThe community flourished until the mid-16th century, when the English Reformation disrupted the Catholic establishment in Ireland. From that time on, the monks of Claregalway struggled to keep the abbey viable against political and economic forces.\\nOn 11 July 1538, forces under the command of Lord Leonard Gray ransacked and looted the abbey while on march to Galway. In 1570, Queen Elizabeth I granted possession of the monastery to Sir Richard de Burgo. In 1589, the monastery buildings were turned into a barracks under the administration of the English provincial governor, Sir Richard Bingham.\\nDuring the reign of King James, the property was given to the Earl of Clanrickarde. By 1641, the Franciscans had reoccupied the abbey, but the building was in poor repair and the community lacked the ability to renovate it.\\nIn 1731, Edward Synge, Anglican archbishop of Tuam recorded that \"there is a friary in Claregalway, where three at least are always resident.\" The High Sheriff of the county, Stratford Eyre, reported in 1732 that the monks \"lived close\" to the abbey.\\nChurch records indicate that the community numbered about 220 religious in 1766, but this number had declined to about 150 by 1782. French diplomat Coquebert de Montbret wrote in 1791 that \"the monks are settling down among the ruins.\"\\nThe size of the community continued to dwindle. By 1838, it was down to only two members. Archives of the Galway Vindicator, a local newspaper, indicate that the community\\'s last two monks departed for a larger community in Galway in November 1847. For some years after the monastery closed, members of the Galway friary continued to travel to the site on feast days to celebrate Mass and hear confession, but these activities had ceased by 1860.\\nIn 1892, a Lord Clanmorris donated the property to the Commissioner of Public Works under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments Act of 1882.\\nToday, the abbey buildings and grounds are open to the public free of charge.

It officially started on May 15, 1969, in the eastern Pacific and lasted until November 30, 1969. However, the first named storm, Ava, did not form until July 1, the latest date that the first named storm of a season formed. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\\nThis season was below average in activity with ten named storms forming, of which only four reached hurricane strength, making it the third least active season, tied with the 1995 and 1979. There were no major hurricanes this year. Most of the storms that formed this season never approached land.\\nNotable storms include Tropical Storm Emily and Hurricane Jennifer. The precursor disturbance of Tropical Storm Emily killed nine people in Mexico and left 100,000 homeless. Hurricane Jennifer was the only landfalling named storm of the season, causing one death. In this season, only three storms (Ava, Bernice, and Florence) were operationally categorized as tropical depressions at the first advisory. All other storms were operationally upgraded directly to storm strength, bypassing the depression stage.\\nSystems.\\nTropical Depression One.\\nThe first depression of the season formed off the coast of Mexico on May 30 and moved westward. The depression dissipated the next day.\\nTropical Depression Two.\\nTropical Depression Two formed on June 4 and lasted until June 5, when the storm was considered dissipated. The depression would regenerate on June 7, but, like its previous time active, only lasted until the day later, only this time, the depression never regenerated.\\nTropical Storm Ava.\\nOn June 30, an area of convection formed off the coast of Guatemala. The system showed no signs of development when June ended, but on July 1 the storm began gaining organization and, after a circulation had developed, was deemed a tropical depression. The depression further intensified, becoming a tropical storm on July 2. Ava tracked west-northwestward at a pace of while going through steady intensification. Ava then began to decelerate in forward motion, and after the storm had turned to a more northward path, reached its peak intensity of on July 5. On July 7, Ava was downgraded to a depression while near Socorro Island and the last advisory was issued on the weakened Ava later that day. The remains of Ava continued northwest and then took a westward move on July 10. By this point, Ava had completely dissipated.\\nDespite its proximity to land, no reports of damages or deaths were reported in connection to Ava. When Ava formed on July 1, it became the latest that a tropical storm had formed in the East Pacific basin.\\nHurricane Bernice.\\nThe system that became Hurricane Bernice was an area of disturbed weather. After signs of a circulation appeared on July 8, the system was designated a tropical depression. The depression developed and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bernice on July 10. Bernice continued a west-northwestard motion and, on July 12, achieved Category\\xa01 strength. Bernice then accelerated in forward speed from 9\\xa0mph to . Afterwards, Bernice began to weaken, with it being downgraded into a storm on July 15. Further weakening commenced, and Bernice was downgraded to a depression on July 16. The final advisory on Bernice was issued on July 17. Bernice never affected land.\\nBernice can be seen in photographs taken by Apollo 11 on the 16th, and could also be seen in a TV broadcast made by the astronauts.\\nTropical Storm Claudia.\\nOn July 21, a tropical depression advisory was issued on a loosely organized area of convection based on satellite pictures because of a lack of ships reporting in the area where it formed. The initial forecast was for an increase in strength and motion into the easterlies at a pace of . On July 22, it was decided that the system had achieved enough organization to become a tropical storm and was named Claudia. Claudia\\'s time as a tropical storm was brief; it was downgraded into a depression on July 23, only 24\\xa0hours after first becoming a storm. The storm continued to weaken, dissipating later that day.\\nBecause of a lack of shipping near where Claudia existed, intensity forecasts were based almost entirely on satellite presentation. The only ship near the storm was a Navy vessel named \"Fernie\". The ship reported an eastward wind of about 50\\xa0miles from the center and a pressure of 1006 mb.\\nHurricane Doreen.\\nLike Claudia before it, Doreen\\'s formation (which started as a large cloud mass on the ITCZ) went mostly unmonitored by ship because of a lack of shipping. On August 4, a relatively unusual cirrus cloud formation resembling a pinwheel formed over the center of the storm. The formation had provided efficient evidence that the system had developed into a tropical storm, bypassing the depression stage. Doreen continued a northwest track, deepening along the way, and on August 5, a ship reported winds with a 993 mb pressure near the storm center. Based on this, Doreen was upgraded to a hurricane, the second of the season.\\nFrom here, Doreen began to take a more west-northwest path, passing by Socorro Island on August 6. On August 7, Doreen\\'s eye broke up and, as a result, Doreen quickly weakened, being downgraded into a tropical storm shortly afterward. Continued weakening brought Doreen down to a depression on August 8, when Doreen slowed to a crawl. Doreen held on to depression strength until August 9, when it entered an area of easterlies, which did nothing to help the already-weakening Doreen, but rather dissipating it quickly. Traces of Doreen continued to show up on satellite until August 11, when no traces remained.\\nTropical Depression Seven.\\nA very short lived storm, Tropical Depression Seven formed off the coast of Mexico on August 5, dissipating the same day.\\nTropical Storm Emily.\\nEmily\\'s origins can be traced back to a large low-pressure center over Mexico that persisted from August 20 to August 21. During that time, thunderstorm activity flared up over the Mexican mainland, but no evidence of a circulation was found. However, on August 21, a circulation developed at around 14° N and was apparent on weather maps, but at the time, no major winds were suspected near the center. Finally, on August 22, a ship in the area reported 45-50\\xa0mph (72–80\\xa0km/h) winds, and based on this report, the system was initiated as Tropical Storm Emily, becoming the third storm in a row to have been upgraded straight to tropical storm strength, bypassing depression stage. From this point on, early reports on Emily were plagued by delays, namely the initial formation report, which was delayed long enough to miss the first advisory. A 998 mb pressure was recorded in Emily on August 23 and Emily reached its peak intensity of later that day, with a circular eye being reported by recon. Suddenly, Emily started rapidly weakening, becoming poorly defined later that day, and by August 24, no traces of Emily remained.\\nWhile no casualties or damages were reported in connection to Emily, the low-pressure center that formed Emily was responsible for nine deaths on the mainland and rendered 100,000 homeless due to flooding.\\nTropical Storm Florence.\\nA low-pressure area that persisted off the coast of Mexico produced squalls during late August and early September. On September 2, the system developed and became a tropical depression. The depression was deemed a storm after satellite imagery showed a cloud pattern typical of a tropical storm and the depression was upgraded after the fact.\\nFlorence continued northward, strengthening to near-hurricane intensity with peak winds of and a pressure of 992 mb. On September 7, Florence moved into colder water, which took a fast and heavy toll on Florence, weakening it to a depression shortly afterward and, not long after the downgrade, Florence had dissipated.\\nHurricane Glenda.\\nThe remains of what was formerly Hurricane Francelia crossed over Central America and contributed to an area of convection that formed 120\\xa0miles southwest of Acapulco. A separate mass of clouds existed west-northwest of the main disturbance but, unlike the former, this mass did not organize. The storm began to organize and, like nearly all other storms of this season, Glenda was named on September 7, bypassing the depression phase when a report from a ship indicated a barometric pressure of 997 mb and was falling rapidly as well as reporting heavy showers. Glenda continued its motion northwest while increasing in strength, with a closed eye being noticed on September 9. Because of the closed eye and cirrus cap, it was determined that Glenda had become a hurricane.\\nGlenda\\'s time as a hurricane was very short lived as it was downgraded to a storm just six hours after the initial upgrade. The weakening trend continued while it moved northwest, towards the Baja California Peninsula, but Glenda moved westward, avoiding landfall. It dissipated on September 12.\\nTropical Storm Heather.\\nThe information is unclear on how Heather developed but she was first noticed on September 18 1,000\\xa0miles southwest of La Paz, Baja California. Like Claudia and Doreen, Heather\\'s lifespan was mostly monitored by satellite and Air Force recon because of a lack of shipping in the general area. From where it first grew, Heather moved west-northwest, reached its peak intensity of winds, and then eventually weakened to a depression on September 22 and was considered dissipated. On September 23, however, Heather regenerated. Heather would begin to accelerate, followed by a westward motion on September 25, dissipating later that day, this time for good.\\nHeather\\'s peak intensity was kept at 65\\xa0mph both operationally and in post-season because of cool inflow. However, Heather\\'s satellite presentation more resembled a hurricane, showing broad spiral arms.\\nTropical Storm Irah.\\nRadio interference and low angle plagued research into a possible circulation that had developed in an area of the ITCZ during September 28 and September 29. Finally, on September 30, a depression was thought to have developed. However, a bulletin from a different source provided with a mosaic image was the evidence used in giving the system the name Irah and treating it as a tropical storm. Irah moved west-northwest until October 1, when it curved northward. By this point, Irah had started weakening, dropping into a depression on October 3. Shortly afterward, Irah had degenerated into an area of squalls.\\nTropical Depression Thirteen.\\nTropical Depression Thirteen formed off the coast of Mexico on October 3. Moving north-northwest, the depression made landfall late on October 4, dissipating soon thereafter. No deaths or damages were reported in connection to the depression.\\nTropical Depression Fourteen.\\nTropical Depression Fourteen formed on October 4 and dissipated the day after.\\nHurricane Jennifer.\\nThe final storm of the season, Jennifer, had a similar origin to Irah when it originated from an area of disturbed weather on the ITCZ. The system proceeded to develop and became a tropical disturbance, but no reports showed that the system was a tropical cyclone, although they reported winds and showers. On October 8, a German ship in the area relayed a message to the bureau mentioning an area with a 995 mb pressure (the ship had previously recorded 1003 mb before it sharply fell to the 995 reported). Later, another ship reported winds in the vicinity, prompting the advisories that Tropical Storm Jennifer had formed. Jennifer moved to the northwest, obtaining hurricane strength on October 9. At this time, Jennifer was 200\\xa0miles off shore, moving northwest at , paralleling the coast. Then Jennifer turned to the northeast while accelerating, ending up about 60\\xa0miles west of Mazatlán. Around this time, a dropsonde malfunction ceased any penetration into the storm, but the plane estimated the winds of the storm to be winds. On late October 11, Jennifer moved onshore and dissipated on October 12.\\nJennifer was reported to have killed one person and injured 15, all in Mazatlán. Jennifer also caused a ferry and twelves boats used for fishing shrimp to be washed up in the Mazatlán Harbor. Over 30 other shrimp boats were reported missing, but were moored in unknown areas. Damage was reportedly extensive, but no monetary figures exist.\\nStorm names.\\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1969. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1973 season. This is the same list as list 2 used during 1960–1965, except for Heather, which replaced Hazel. A storm was named Heather for the first time in 1969. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\\nThe Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific\\'s typhoon list.

It became a global movement targeting design initiatives and incorporating environmental motives to improve product design in order to minimize health and environmental impacts by incorporating it from design stage all the way to the manufacturing process. The DfE strategy aims to improve technology and design tactics to expand the scope of products. By incorporating eco-efficiency into design tactics, DfE takes into consideration the entire life-cycle of the product, while still making products usable but minimizing resource use. The key focus of DfE is to minimize the environmental-economic cost to consumers while still focusing on the life-cycle framework of the product. By balancing both customer needs as well as environmental and social impacts DfE aims to \"improve the product use experience both for consumers and producers, while minimally impacting the environment\".\\nDesign for Environment practices.\\nFour main concepts that fall under the DfE umbrella.\\nLife-cycle assessment (LCA) is employed to forecast the impacts of different (production) alternatives of the product in question, thus being able to choose the most environmentally friendly. A life cycle analysis can serve as a tool when determining the environmental impact of a product or process. Proper LCAs can help a designer compare several different products according to several categories, such as energy use, toxicity, acidification, emissions, ozone depletion, resource depletion and many others. By comparing different products, designers can make decisions about which environmental hazard to focus on in order to make the product more environmentally friendly.\\nWhy do firms want to design for the environment?\\nModern day businesses all aim to produce goods at a low cost while maintaining quality, staying competitive in the global marketplace, and meeting consumer preferences for more environment friendly products. To help businesses meet these challenges, EPA encourages businesses to incorporate environmental considerations into the design process. The benefits of incorporating DfE include: cost savings, reduced business and environmental risks, expanded business and market opportunities, and to meet environmental regulations.\\nCompanies and products.\\nBesides these large brand names there are several other consumer product companies in the DfE program this including:\\nHow does a business design for the environment?\\nA business can design for the environment by:\\nSafer Choice labeling program.\\nEPA\\'s DfE labeling program was renamed \"Safer Choice\" in 2015.\\nCurrent U.S. laws and regulations encouraging DfE in the electronics industry.\\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).\\nEPA promulgated the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to establish basic air pollution control requirements across the U.S. The NAAQS sets standards on six main sources of pollutants, which include emissions of: ozone (0.12 ppm per 1 hour), carbon monoxide (35 ppm per 1 hour; primary standard), particulate matter (50g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), sulfur dioxide (80g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), nitrogen dioxide (100g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), and lead emissions (1.5g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean).\\nStratospheric ozone protection.\\nStratospheric ozone protection is required by section 602 of the Clean Air Act of 1990. This regulation aims to decrease emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chemicals that are destroying the stratospheric ozone layer. The protection initiative categorizes ozone-depleting substances into two classes: Class I, and Class II.\\nClass I substances include 20 different kinds of chemicals and have all been phased-out of production processes since 2000. Class II substances consist of 33 different hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The EPA has already begun plans to decrease emissions in HCFCs and plan to completely phase out the class II substances by 2030.\\nReporting requirements for releases of toxic substances.\\nA firm operating in the electronics industry in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes 20-39 that has more than 10 full-time employees and consumes more than 10,000\\xa0lbs per year of any toxic chemical lists in 40 CFR 372.65 must file a toxic release inventory.'),\n ('8035060',\n  'Ecosystem model',\n  'An ecosystem model is an abstract, usually mathematical, representation of an ecological system (ranging in scale from an individual population, to an ecological community, or even an entire biome), which is studied to better understand the real system.\\nUsing data gathered from the field, ecological relationships—such as the relation of sunlight and water availability to photosynthetic rate, or that between predator and prey populations—are derived, and these are combined to form ecosystem models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).\\nEcosystem models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as natural resource management, ecotoxicology and environmental health, agriculture, and wildlife conservation. Ecological modelling has even been applied to archaeology with varying degrees of success, for example, combining with archaeological models to explain the diversity and mobility of stone tools.\\nTypes of models.\\nThere are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) \"analytic\" models and (2) \"simulation\" / \"computational\" models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power. Ecopath is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model marine ecosystems. It is widely used by marine and fisheries scientists as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\\nModel design.\\nThe process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model.\\nEcological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this complexity, ecosystem models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve.\\nThe process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of state variables and mathematical functions that describe the nature of the relationships between them. The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.\\nAfter establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of space used. Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. \"Spatially explicit models\" (also called \"spatially distributed\" or \"landscape\" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model. A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables.\\nValidation.\\nAfter construction, models are \"validated\" to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model\\'s output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data.\\nExamples.\\nThe Lotka–Volterra equations.\\nOne of the earliest, and most well-known, ecological models is the predator-prey model of Alfred J. Lotka (1925) and Vito Volterra (1926). This model takes the form of a pair of ordinary differential equations, one representing a prey species, the other its predator.\\nwhere,\\nVolterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in fish and shark populations observed in the Adriatic Sea after the First World War (when fishing was curtailed). However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally. Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models: modelled biological populations experience growth, interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or competitors) and suffer mortality.\\nA credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.\\nOthers.\\nThe theoretical ecologist Robert Ulanowicz has used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication.\\nConway\\'s Game of Life and its variations model ecosystems where proximity of the members of a population are factors in population growth.'),\n ('8035065',\n  'Leonidas Tapia',\n  'Leonidas Tapia (?-1977) was a Puebloan potter from Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico, United States. \\nBiography.\\nShe was the wife of Jose Blas Tapia and mother of Mary Trujillo (born 1937) and Tom Tapia (b. 1946).

The flowers open late in the day (hence some of its common names), but when closed have a green stripe on the outside. It is native throughout most of southern and central Europe, and north-western Africa. \"O. umbellatum\" is often grown as a garden ornamental, but in North America and other areas it has escaped cultivation and can be found in many areas, where it may become an invasive noxious weed. Parts of the plant are considered poisonous, but are used in some regional cuisines. Essences are also sold as patent remedies. \"O. umbellatum\" has been depicted in art by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, and folklore has suggested it originally grew from fragments of the star of Bethlehem, hence its horticultural name.\\nDescription.\\n\"O. umbellatum\" is a perennial herbaceous bulbous plant (geophyte), dying back after flowering, to an underground storage bulb. The following year, it regrows from the often shallow rooted bulbs, which are ovoid with a membranous coat, long and in diameter. The bulbs form multiple leaf-bearing bulbils that soon separate but remain close by. Initially the plant forms 6–10 basal leaves, that arise in tufts from the bulbs. The leaves are grooved (canaliculate), smooth (glabrous) and linear with a white to light green linear midrib on the upper surface, and grow up to long and broad.\\n\"O. umbellatum\" is scapose, with a glabrous flower stem (scape) that emerges from the leaf tufts later and is about in height, tapering at its tip. \\nThe inflorescence bears 6–20 flat star shaped flowers on ascending stems (pedicels) () associated with membranaceous leaflets (bracts) () in an open branching umbrella (umbel) shaped terminal cluster, described as a corymbose raceme. The petal-like perianth is radially symmetric (actinomorphic), which is in diameter, consists of six lanceolate tepals which are white with a green stripe on the underside (outside), in length and wide. From the outside the closed flower appears green with white margins.\\nThe reproductive parts consist of both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) parts (hermaphrodite). The androecium has six yellow-brown stamens that are free of the perianth and form two groups, each of about , with filaments that are simple and flattened and oblong anthers that are . The gynoecium has a single pistil with a superior (i. e. above the floral parts) ovary that is ovoid to obovoid, , and longer than the style that extends above it. The fruit is a capsule which is oblong-ovoid with 3 sides and 6 ribs. Within it, each locule contains many seeds with a black coat of phytomelan (\"see Floral diagram\"). The species is polyploid (having more than two sets of chromosomes).\\nTaxonomy.\\n\"Ornithogalum umbellatum\" has been known and described for a long time, according to some authors, as far back as Dioscorides in the first century. In 16th-century England, William Turner (1562) mentions it. In Henry Lyte\\'s 1586 \"New Herbal\" (a translation into English of Dodoens\\' 1554 \"Cruydeboeck\"), reference is made to an \"Ornithogalum\" as the White Field Onion. John Gerard, in his \"Herball\" of 1597, describes \"Ornithogalum\" as the \"star of Bethlem\". The species known today as \"Ornithogalum umbellatum\" was first formally described by Linnaeus (1753), who is the botanical authority for the species (L.). \"O. umbellatum\" is the type species of the genus \"Ornithogalum\", which contains about 50 species. The lectotype (reference specimen) was established by Stearn in 1983.\\nEtymology.\\nThe species epithet reflects the flower formation as an umbel. The plant\\'s many common names include garden star-of-Bethlehem, sleepydick, nap-at-noon, grass lily, summer snowflake, snowdrop, starflower, bird\\'s milk, chinkerichee, ten-o\\'clock lady, eleven-o\\'clock lady, Bath asparagus, and star of Hungary. The references to the time of day reflect the opening times of the flowers, opening late and closing at night or in cloudy conditions. The star names indicate the arrangement of the petals and bird\\'s milk is a literal translation of ornithogalum. It has also been called dove\\'s dung, equating it with a plant described in the bible. The name star-of-Bethlehem is shared by a number of species of \"Ornithogalum\", due to the white stellate flowers, and the folklore relating the flower to the biblical star-of-Bethlehem (\"see In popular culture\").\\nDistribution and habitat.\\nA native of most of Europe, North Africa and western Asia, \"Ornithogalum umbellatum\" has been adopted as an ornamental garden plant from where it has escaped and naturalised widely in North America, where it is considered an aggressive noxious weed of lawns, gardens and no-till agricultural land, which can be difficult to eradicate. In Europe its range extends from Ireland and Portugal in the west, Italy in the south, north to parts of France and east to Turkey and the Levant.\\n\"O. umbellatum\" prefers damp habitats, being found along rivers, streams, and lower, wet areas of pastures. It is tolerant to shade and soil type.\\nEcology.\\nLife cycle.\\n\"Ornithogalum umbellatum\" is thermoperiodic, requiring a cold winter to complete its life cycle. It first appears in early spring as tufts of leaves, prior to flowering (proteranthous), which occurs in late spring (May–June), the leaves fading prior to blooming. It reproduces by its bulbs, which form many offsetting bulbils that can be dispersed by water. Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. \"O. umbellatum\" spreads aggressively in clumps by means of these offsets.\\nPollination.\\nThe flowers are insect pollinated, but may also be self-fertile, forming seeds in summer (June–July). Seed dispersal plays a relatively minor role in propagation, but accounts for isolated blooms.\\nEffect of light.\\nThe petals exhibit photoperiodism, often opening at noon and closing at night or on cloudy days.\\nCultivation.\\n\"Ornithogalum umbellatum\" requires considerable moisture during winter and spring, but can tolerate summer drought. It can be grown in a woodland garden as semi-shade is preferable. It is hardy to zone 5 UK, 4–9 USDA, and can become invasive. It is produced commercially as an ornamental garden plant. To control invasive tendencies, it is best to plant in a container or an edged area. \"O. umbellatum\" may be grown as an indoor plant.\\nToxicity.\\nThe plant, especially the bulb and flowers, contains cardiac glycosides, specifically convallatoxin and convalloside which are toxic to humans and livestock. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath, as well as pain, burning, and swelling of lips, tongue, and throat. Prolonged contact may lead to skin irritation.\\nUses.\\nDespite the known toxicities, the plant has been described as edible for 2000 years and incorporated into some traditional regional cuisines (e.g. Turkey) and traditional medicine (e.g. India). In Britain, the plant has long been the subject of herbals for its claimed culinary and medicinal properties. This includes drying and grinding the bulbs, or boiling them and baking the flowers into bread. Essences are sold as patent remedies and for aromatherapy, such as Bach flower remedies. Medical authorities advise against ingesting any part of the plant.\\nIn popular culture.\\nLeonardo da Vinci drew \"O. umbellatum\" and included the plant in one of his depictions of Leda and the Swan (1508–1515), in which the flowers are held in Leda\\'s left hand. In folklore, the biblical star of Bethlehem is said to have fallen to the earth and shattered into pieces which became the ubiquitous white flowers. Legend has also associated it with the journeys of Crusaders and pilgrims to the Holy Land.\\nA biblical passage in \"2 Kings\" 6:25 relates an account of a siege in Samaria in which the desperate population consumed the excrement of doves (chiriyonim). \"There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey\\'s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove\\'s dung for five shekels of silver\". There has been considerable discussion as to the exact meaning of this term. In notes taken by Paul Dietrich Giseke from a lecture by Linnaeus it is suggested that this \"Stercus Columbarum\" was in fact the plant \"Ornithogalum umbellatum\", which grew abundantly in Palestine and \"unde Anglis \"Bethlem\\'s Star\" dicitur\" (is known to the English as Bethlem\\'s Star), the white colour of which resembled the excrement of birds, hence the name \"lac Avium\" (bird milk or \"Ornithogalum\"), and which was still eaten by the poor of that country.\\nCulturally, the flower has been associated with purity and hope, atonement and reconciliation.'),\n ('8035168',\n  'George P.

Augustine of Hippo, for instance, stated \"Est ergo in nobis quaedam, ut dicam, docta ignorantia, sed docta spiritu dei, qui adiuvat infirmitatem nostram\" [\"There is therefore in us a certain learned ignorance, so to speak — an ignorance which we learn from that Spirit of God who helps our infirmities\"]; here he explains the working of the Holy Spirit among men and women, despite their human insufficiency, as a learned ignorance. The Christian writer Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite advises his reader to ἀγνώστως ἀνατάθητι, to \"strive upwards unknowingly\". Bonaventura of Bagnoregio declared \"spiritus noster non-solum efficitur agilis ad ascensum verum etiam quadam ignorantia docta supra se ipsum rapitur in caliginem et excessum\" [\"we are lifted into divine knowing without directly striving for it\"].\\nFor Cusanus, \"docta ignorantia\" means that since mankind can not grasp the infinity of a deity through rational knowledge, the limits of science need to be passed by means of speculation. This mode of inquiry blurs the borders between science and \"ignorantia\". In other words, both reason and a supra-rational understanding are needed to understand God. This leads to the \"coincidentia oppositorum\", a union of opposites, a doctrine common in mystic beliefs from the Middle Ages. These ideas influenced other Renaissance scholars in Cusanus\\' day, such as Pico della Mirandola.'),\n ('8035240',\n  'Fritz Schäffer',\n  'Fritz Schäffer (12 May 1888 – 29 March 1967) was a German politician of the Bavarian People\\'s Party (BVP) and the Christian Social Union (CSU). He was the Bavarian Minister of Finance from 1931 to 1933, when the Nazis came to power in Berlin. In 1945 he became the first Minister President of Bavaria to hold office after the end of the Second World War. From 1949 to 1957, he was the West German federal Minister of Finance and, from 1957 to 1961, federal Minister of Justice.\\nBiography.\\nFritz Schäffer was born in 1888 as the son of Gottfried Schäffer and Amalia Mayr. He went to school in Ingolstadt, Munich and Neuburg an der Donau, afterwards studying law in Munich. He joined as a volunteer the Bavarian \"Infanterie-Leib-Regiment\" in 1915. After service in Serbia and Tyrol, he was wounded at Verdun in May 1916 and released from army service.\\nSchäffer started working for the Bavarian state government in 1917. He married Else Dyroff in September 1917.\\nHe was imprisoned from 1933 until 1934, after which he worked as a lawyer. He was imprisoned again in Dachau concentration camp after the July 20 Plot until the end of World War II, from August to October 1944.\\nPolitics.\\nFrom 1918 to 1933, Schäffer was a member of the BVP. In 1929, he became chairman of this Bavarian regionalist party. From 1920 to 1933, he was a member of the Landtag of Bavaria. In his early political career, he made some anti-Semitic speeches, a fact that would haunt him in his later political life. Nevertheless, he opposed the Nazis\\' rise to power in Bavaria and took part in the formation of the \"Bayernwacht\" in 1931, an organisation aimed at protecting conservative politicians from the SA. He aimed at forming a coalition, which would include the Nazi Party and the Centre Party, arguing that such a step would neutralise the Nazi party to some extent. After this failed, he attempted to elevate the last Bavarian crown prince, Rupprecht, to the dictatorial position of \"Staatskommissar\". The move ultimately failed due to the resistance of Bavarian prime minister, Heinrich Held, who feared that Schäffer would be made prime minister in his stead.\\nIn 1933, he found himself imprisoned for his actions against the Nazis.\\nIn 1945 he was among the founders of the CSU. He was engaged in continuous strife with the party leader, Josef Müller over party politics. Müller wished to make the party multi-confessional, while Schäffer tried to move it towards a revival of the Catholic-dominated BVP. He was made the first postwar prime minister of Bavaria by General George S. Patton in 1945, but was relieved of his post by General Dwight D. Eisenhower after a couple of months, when his anti-Semitic past became known. Eisenhower, unlike Patton, also disliked the fact that Schäffer hired ex-Nazis for his administration. He was barred from politics by the US authorities until 1948, accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. He managed to clear himself of this charge and reentered politics afterwards.\\nFrom 1949 to 1961, he was a member of the Bundestag. He became Minister of Finance of the new Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 and held this post until 1957. In 1957, after elections, Konrad Adenauer, chancellor of Germany, attempted to remove Schäffer from his cabinet as his tight fiscal policies were felt as a hindrance to Germany\\'s economic growth. After political negotiations, Schäffer was awarded the justice ministry instead.\\nDuring his time as German Minister of Finance, he became the second-most powerful man in federal politics. He was known for his tight fiscal policies, aimed at keeping the German currency stable. In this role, he strongly resisted any reparation claims to victims of the Nazi reign.

It has a thick trunk and a shuttlecock-shaped, bushy crown. The nutritious, edible fruits are an important local food source and materials made from the tree, fruit, and seed kernels are commercially significant to the region. Hammocks are made from the tree’s fibres. \"Murumuru\" butter is moisturizing (emollient). It is also film-forming and glossy. These qualities make it very protective. It contains vitamins and has a high content of oleic acid. The oil from the seeds is traditionally used to soften and protect hair. \"Murumuru\" butter is the white to yellowish fat obtained from the seeds of the \"murumuru\" palm.\\nEcology.\\nThe Murumuru palm (\"Astrocaryum murumuru\") is abundant in the Brazilian Amazon, extending to the borders of Bolivia and Peru. It prefers to grow in periodically flooded areas, especially on islands and in lowlands along the rivers throughout the Amazon River estuary and its tributaries, in dense or semi-open forests.\\nIt is also frequently found in the lowlands of Marajo Island. The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20\\xa0cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting. When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean. The seed\\'s hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100\\xa0kg of dry seeds (12–15% water) yields 27\\xa0kg to 29\\xa0kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil. A single Murumuru palm produces about 11\\xa0kg of dry seeds. Hydraulic extraction can produce 35% oil relative to the dry weight of the kernel, which is equivalent to about 3.8 liters of oil per Murumuru palm. The kernels must be ground with grinding discs before hydraulic extraction. A kilogram of fruit pulp contains approximately 50 seeds. Seed germination is moderate and growth in the field is slow.\\nAstrocaryum murumuru butter.\\nMurumuru butter contains lauric, myristic, and oleic acids. The fruit contains a white butter that is odorless and tasteless and has the advantage of not becoming rancid easily. The quality of Murumuru butter is similar to the seed fat of the Tucumã palm and coconut palm, but it has the advantage of providing greater consistency because of its melting point (33 C), which is superior to that of the Tucumã palm (30\\xa0°C) and coconut palm (22.7\\xa0°C). The quality of Murumuru butter makes it possible to mix it with other vegetable butters that have a lower melting point. It can also be used to partially substitute cocoa butter in chocolate, providing a firmer consistency in environments where the temperature is higher..\\nMurumuru butter has the great advantage of having a low acidity value (4% to 5%), especially when made from fresh seeds, which reduces the cost of refinement.\\nMurumuru butter was highly valued in Europe and the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, when it served as an ingredient in vegetable creams and soaps. Today, soaps containing Murumuru butter together with Ucuuba butter leave a protection layer on the skin similar to silicone, only it does not clog the pores.\\nMurumuru butter is used in small amounts in shampoos (0.5% to 1%) and formulas for conditioners, creams, soaps, lipsticks and deodorants (0.5% to 8%).'),\n ('8035265',\n  'Rolf Dahlgrün',\n  'Rolf Dahlgrün (19 May 1908 – 19 December 1969) was a German politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP).

RMS \"Umbria\" was built by John Elder &amp; Co. at Glasgow, Scotland in 1884. \"Umbria\" and her running mate \"Etruria\" were record breakers. They were the largest liners then in service, and they plied the Liverpool-to-New York City service. RMS \"Umbria\" was launched by the Honourable Mrs. Hope on 25 June 1884 with wide coverage by the press, the reason being that she was the largest ship afloat, apart from , but by this time that ship was redundant.\\nConstruction.\\n\"Umbria\" had many distinguishing features that included two enormous funnels which gave the outward impression of huge power. She also had three large steel masts which when fully rigged had an extensive spread of canvas. Another innovation on \"Umbria\" was that she was equipped with refrigeration machinery, but it was the single-screw propulsion that would bring the most publicity later in her career. The ship epitomized the luxuries of Victorian style. The public rooms in the first class were full of ornately carved furniture, heavy velvet curtains hung in all the rooms, and they were decorated with the bric-a-brac that period fashion dictated. These rooms and the first-class cabins were situated on the promenade, upper, saloon, and main decks. There was also a music room, a smoking room for gentlemen, and separate dining rooms for first- and second-class passengers. By the standard of the day, the second-class accommodation was modest but spacious and comfortable.

She was due to arrive in New York on Christmas Day. By 28 December she still had not arrived and speculation as to what had delayed her was growing. News came on 29 December from the steamship \"Galileo\", which had passed her on Christmas Day. She appeared disabled. The master of \"Galileo\" also reported that she displayed three red lights, indicating that she was unmanageable, but did not require assistance. The weather was said to be foul with a severe north-westerly gale. Another steamer called \"Monrovian\" had also passed her but reported \"Umbria\" to be in good shape. On 30 December the steamship \"Manhanset\" reported that again \"Umbria\" did not require assistance and that she was carrying out repairs to a broken shaft. In fact \"Umbria\"s troubles had started on 23 December at around 5:25\\xa0p.m. Her propeller shaft had fractured at the thrust block. Her main engines were stopped immediately, and \"Umbria\" drifted helplessly in gale-force winds and a heavy sea. The chief engineer worked relentlessly with his staff to make repairs to the shaft. Later that day at 8:15 pm the steamship \"Bohemia\" had agreed to tow the ship to New York, but the line broke around 10 p.m. in the severe storm and visibility was nil. Next morning there was no sign of \"Bohemia\", and once again \"Umbria\" was drifting helplessly. Then came the encounters with the other two steamers, but by 26 December the Cunarder \"Gallia\" and \"Umbria\" had established contact with each other and after some communications between masters, \"Gallia\" had refused to stand by, and carried on her voyage; \"Umbria\" was left to make repairs.

It was here that \"Umbria\" struck the sunken hulk and became stuck fast. All day she remained stuck until the combination of a flood tide and the service of seven tugs managed to pull her free of the wreck, to the cheers of the Yale rowing crew who were aboard \"Umbria\" on their way to take part in the Henley Regatta.

In 1903 \"Umbria\" hit the headlines again. On 9 May, the New York City police department received a letter that explained that a bomb had been loaded aboard \"Umbria\" The letter went on to say that the bomb had been intended for the White Star Line\\'s , but that the bombers had changed their minds because there were a large number of women and children aboard that ship. At noon that day \"Umbria\" was still at her berth and she was due to sail. Immediately the police sealed off the pier head and told the captain to delay the sailing. The police searched the ship and found the bomb. It was in a box long by wide and had been placed close to the 1st class gangway. One of the police officers tied a rope around the box and lowered it into the sea. When the box was lifted back up and opened, it was found to have of dynamite attached to a crude timed fuse. If the bomb had exploded on the ship it would have caused considerable damage. The letter that the police had received also explained that the bomb plot was the work of the Mafia, whose aim was to destroy the British shipping interest in the port of New York. To corroborate this information the police had descriptions of two \"Italian\" men placing the bomb on the pier and the police eventually traced the manufacturer of the bomb back to a Chicago lodging house. The ship eventually got under way to Liverpool on 16 May.\\nLast voyage.\\nBy 1908 the careers of \"Umbria\" and \"Etruria\" were coming to an end; however, because of mishaps to, first \"Etruria\" and then to , which was temporarily laid up and later caught fire, \"Umbria\" had a reprieve until 1910. Her last voyage started on 12 February 1910 and her return crossing on 23 February. She arrived in the Mersey for the last time on 4 March 1910, and as soon as her passengers had disembarked, work began on dismantling all her fixtures and fittings. Within days she was sold for scrap for £20,000 to the Forth Shipbreaking Company, and she was taken to Bo\\'ness, Scotland. There is no doubt that both vessels were considered, in their day, to be giants of the North Atlantic. In all she made 145 round trips to New York.\\nIn popular culture.\\nThe ship is featured briefly in the last several episodes of the third and final season of the horror-drama television series \"Penny Dreadful\". When Sir Malcolm Murray, Ethan Chandler, and Kaetenay are returning to London from the United States, \"Umbria\" is the ship they are travelling aboard: as evidenced by the ships appearance, and the name on a life-preserver on the ship.'),\n ('8035357',\n  'Rank test',\n  'In statistics, a rank test is any test involving ranks.

The process is most commonly observed in printed circuit boards where it may significantly decrease the insulation between conductors.\\nThe main factor facilitating the ECM is humidity. In the presence of water, ECM can go very quickly. Usually the process involves several stages: water adsorption, anode metal dissolution, ion accumulation, ion migration to cathode, and dendritic growth. The growth of the dendrite takes fraction of a second, during which time the resistance between anode and cathode drops almost to zero.\\nCharacteristics.\\nIn addition to the electrical potential difference, the presence of moisture is a driving factor in the ECM. If there is a sufficient film of moisture with condensation and even at low electrical voltage, the ECM can form a bridging structure between the contacts after just a few minutes.\\nIn general, the process can be broken down into the following steps:\\nThis mechanism impairs the reliability and longevity of electronic assemblies.

It is commonly called San Mateo thornmint and is found growing on serpentine soils near the Crystal Springs Reservoir in a six-mile (10\\xa0km) long strip on the east side of Montara Mountain at elevations of approximately 150 to 300\\xa0meters.\\nTaxonomy.\\nThe species is named in honor of Harry Arnold Dutton, who in 1949 located a patch of another rare plant \"Cupressus abramsiana\" on nearby Butano Ridge.\\n\"A. duttonii\" upper stamens are fertile, while the other species have sterile upper stamens. The presence of these fertile upper stamens is used to separate it as a different species from \"Acanthomintha obovata\", in the past \"A. duttonii\" was referred to as subspecies of \"A. obovata\" (\"Acanthomintha obovata\" ssp. \"duttonii\"), James D. Jokerst split the taxon in 1991.\\nDescription.\\nAll \"Acanthomintha\" species.\\nAll four thornmint species are aromatic annual wildflowers native to the state of California in the US. The species have square stems that are erect growing. The leaves are petioled with leaf veins conspicuous and the leaf margins are often spiny. The inflorescences of the \"Acanthomintha\" genus are described as \"head-like, in terminal clusters\" by the genus authority James D. Jokerst. The flowers of this entire genus are like, most mints, two-lipped forming a tube with five sepals and the stamens enclosed within the zygomorphic corolla. The bracts in the inflorescence have marginal spines, thus the basis of the common name \\'thornmints\\'. All \"Acanthomintha\" have the upper three lobes of its calyx acuminate and the lower two lobes oblong in shape; furthermore, all \"Acanthomintha corollae\" are funnel shaped and white with occasional tinting of purple. Each \"Acanthomintha\" species has four stamens, with the upper two reduced. Thornmint styles are slender and their fruit is ovoid in shape with a smooth exterior texture.\\n\"Acanthomintha duttonii\".\\n\"A. duttonii\" has a stem which is generally unbranched and less than twenty centimeters in length; the stem may present short hairs or none at all. Leaves of this species are eight to twelve millimeters in length, lanceolate to obovate in shape. The margins of this spiny leaf are occasionally serrate. The terminal inflorescences have bracts of about five to eleven millimeters; moreover, these bracts are ovate and green at the flower, with five or seven marginal spines, each three to seven millimeters. The virtually hairless to sparse short haired calyx is five to eight millimeters in length, while the corolla is 12\\xa0to 16\\xa0millimeters in extent. The white corolla is often tinged lavender in color; the corolla throat is cream colored and its upper lip is hooded, while the longer lower lip is reflexed and three-lobed. The upper lip is more diminutive than the lower, and is entire and shallowly hooded. The flower bracts are broadly ovate in shape with puberulent hairs and shiny. The bracts have seven to nine spines each. The anthers are short and hairy. The style is glabrous. Plants bloom in April into late June, with each flower when fertilized producing four nut-like seeds. Plants are self-fertile.\\nDistribution.\\nThe range of this species is sharply limited within a portion of central San Mateo County on the eastern lower slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains.\\nThe single remaining large population, in Edgewood County Park, is a relict of a more extensive colony damaged by off-road motor-vehicle use. There is an introduced population at Pulgas Ridge Open Space Preserve, and native fragments along the lower slopes above Crystal Springs Reservoir in a six-mile-long (10\\xa0km) fragmented strip that includes the Edgewood colony.\\nEcology.\\nThis species is only known to grow on serpentine soils in grassland communities that are generally species-rich for serpentine soils; the area they are growing in on the San Francisco Peninsula also contains sloping chaparral. Other native species that grow in the same area include \"Nassella pulchra\", \"Delphinium hesperium\", and \"Hemizonia congesta\" var. \"luzulifolia\", plus the exotic \"Lolium multiflorum\".\\nSpecific plant communities where this species is found are chaparral as well as foothill or valley grasslands. San Mateo thornmint populations occupy slopes or flatland with deep, heavy clay soil inclusions.\\nIn general, serpentine soils normally provide an inhospitable environment for most plants. Several factors contribute to serpentine soils being inhospitable to plant growth including a low calcium-magnesium ratio, lack of essential nutrients namely nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, and high concentrations of heavy metals. Many species that have evolved to grow on serpentine soils have are not adapted to compete with other plants and do not survive well under competition in other soils that tend to have denser plant numbers; in serpentine soils plant densities are lower resulting in less direct competition for resources like light and water.\\nConservation.\\nThis rare annual species of wildflower has populations that fluctuates yearly with recorded population ranges in the 1980s from 50,000 plants to as few as 5,000 plants a year.\\nThis species became federally listed as endangered in 1989. California listed San Mateo thornmint as \"rare, threatened, or endangered in California\" under List 1B.1 in 1979, and further classifies this plant as \"seriously endangered in California\". A state of California endangerment rank of S1.1 has been assigned, implying that there are fewer than six populations, fewer than 1000 individuals or fewer than 2000 acres (8\\xa0km2). In the case of \"A. duttonii\", the criteria of occurrences and area may both be present. A global rank of G1 (critically imperilled globally) has been attached to this wildflower.\\nSignificant threats to \"A. duttonii\" identified in 1989 to 1998 were continuing urbanization of the San Francisco Peninsula, an inherently fragmented population and off-road vehicle use. Two or possibly three colonies of San Mateo thornmint may have been eradicated in the 1970s to 80s by off-road vehicle use and road maintenance crews.'),\n ('8035666',\n  'Engelbert of Admont',\n  'Engelbert (c. 1250 – 12 May 1331) was Abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Admont in Styria.\\nLife.\\nHe was born of noble parents at Volkersdorf in Styria, and entered the monastery of Admont about 1267.

Waters was regarded as one of the NFL\\'s dirtiest players, serving as an integral part of one of the league\\'s top defenses. On November 20, 2006, Waters committed suicide and was subsequently diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\\nEarly years.\\nWaters was born in Belle Glade, Florida and grew up in extreme poverty in rural Florida, and attended Pahokee High School. Waters received some attention in high school but ended up attending Cheyney University At Cheyney University of Pennsylvania Waters was recognized as All-PSAC three straight years.\\nNFL career.\\nIn 1984, Waters was signed as an undrafted free agent by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Marion Campbell. He returned a kickoff for an 89-yard game-winning touchdown against the Washington Redskins as a rookie in 1984. When Buddy Ryan took over for Campbell in 1986, he welcomed Waters\\' aggressive style as a fierce tackler and ferocious hitter, earning Waters a position in the starting lineup for the next eight years. He blossomed under defensive coordinator Bud Carson. His tackle of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jim Everett in 1988 led to a rule prohibiting defensive players from hitting quarterbacks below the waist while they are still in the pocket; for a while, it was unofficially termed the \"Andre Waters Rule\". NFL broadcaster Dan Dierdorf notoriously nicknamed the Eagles defender \"Dirty Waters\". He scored a touchdown in 1989 when he took a lateral from William Frizzell after Reggie White caused a fumble by New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms.\\nWaters served as part of the Eagles\\' defensive unit that was regarded as one of the league\\'s all-time best, in 1991 ranking first statistically in both run and pass defense, as well as total defense. His hard-hitting style translated into leading the team in tackles for four seasons and endeared him with Philadelphia fans but often led to penalties and fines for some of his tackles. He led the Eagles in tackles in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1991. He recorded 15 interceptions in 156 games. In 1994, he was replaced by Mike Zordich due to his contract ending.\\nCoaching career.\\nAfter retiring as a player, Waters worked as a college football coach. In 1996, he joined the staff of Stump Mitchell at Morgan State as defensive backs coach. The following year under head coach Jim Leavitt, Waters took the same position on the upstart South Florida football program. He remained in that position until 1999. In 2000, Waters left South Florida to join the St. Louis Rams of the NFL as a coaching intern for training camp. In 2006, the \"St. Petersburg Times\" reported that Leavitt made Waters choose between South Florida and the internship out of concern that Waters would miss too much preparation time with South Florida.\\nAfter his Rams internship, Waters returned to Tampa to be defensive coordinator at Paul R. Wharton High School in 2000. In 2001, Waters moved back to the college level as defensive backs coach at Alabama State. He later coached at St. Augustine\\'s from 2002 to 2005 as defensive coordinator upon the football program\\'s return from a 35-year hiatus. In 2006, Waters was defensive coordinator at Fort Valley State. In 2002, Waters joined the Detroit Lions in his second stint as an NFL coaching intern. In 2006, Waters described his disappointment in not getting a full-time NFL coaching job to \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" reporter Phil Sheridan. He remained very close to his former Eagles coach Buddy Ryan, whom Waters said he tried to emulate in his own coaching career.\\nDeath.\\nWaters died by suicide shortly after 1 a.m. on November 20, 2006, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff\\'s Office, dying of a gunshot to the head. He was at his home in Tampa, Florida where he was discovered by his girlfriend. He was buried at Foreverglades Cemetery in Belle Glade, Florida.\\nShortly after Waters\\' death, former Harvard defensive tackle and WWE wrestler Christopher Nowinski, whose wrestling career was ended by post-concussion syndrome and has since written a book about the dangers of concussions in contact sports, approached Waters\\' family and asked permission to have his brain tissue examined. After receiving permission, Nowinski had samples of Waters\\' brain tissue sent to neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu at the University of Pittsburgh. Omalu believed, having examined the tissue, that Waters sustained brain damage from playing football: he went on to state that this led to Waters\\' depression. Omalu determined that Waters\\' brain tissue had developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and degenerated into that of an 80-year-old man with Alzheimer\\'s disease, caused or hastened by the numerous concussions Waters sustained playing football.\\nWaters was portrayed by actor Richard T.

It was a term used in British philosophy around in the early 1900s.\\nOverview.\\nSome relations are clearly internal in the sense that, for example, four would not be four unless it were related to two in the way it is. Some relations are internal to their bearers under one description but not under another, for example, a wife would not be a wife unless suitably related to a husband, but Mary would still be Mary had she not married. Or take the internal relation where Jack is taller than his wife, Joan. Here the relation is internal to both of them together, in symbolic form it can be given as: Jack(R)Joan, where R is the ordered relation of \"Taller than\". \\nThe doctrine that all relations are internal implies that everything has some relation, however distant, to everything else. Such a doctrine is ascribed by Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore to certain ideas by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the American philosopher, C. S. Peirce. Russell associates it with pragmatism, objective idealism and the absolute idealism of Hegel. It also refers to coherentism, a holist approach to truth.\\nA contemporary of Russell, the English philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead, maintained the necessity of a doctrine of internal relations for the theory of evolution:\\n\"This material is in itself the ultimate substance. Evolution, on the materialistic theory, is reduced to the role of being another word for the description of the changes of the external relations between portions of matter. There is nothing to evolve, because one set of external relations is as good as any other set of external relations. There can merely be change, purposeless and unprogressive. But the whole point of the modem doctrine is the evolution of the complex organisms from antecedent states of less complex organisms. The doctrine thus cries aloud for a conception of organism as fundamental for nature.

It was originally released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in November 2008 and for Mac OS X in October 2010, and is the first title in the \"Left 4 Dead\" series. Set during the aftermath of a zombie outbreak on the East Coast of the United States, the game pits its four protagonists, dubbed the \"Survivors\", against hordes of the infected.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" uses Valve\\'s proprietary Source engine, with four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI, a four-player co-op campaign mode, an eight-player online versus mode, and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence dubbed the \"Director\" controls level pacing and item placements in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" was well-received by the industry media upon its release, with praise for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and cinematic feel, although some criticized its limited level selection and lack of narrative. The game won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with \"Team Fortress 2\", Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The success of the game led to the development of the sequel \"Left 4 Dead 2\", which was released in 2009. In 2012, all \"Left 4 Dead\" campaigns were ported over to \"Left 4 Dead 2\", with cross-platform multiplayer support between Windows and Mac versions of the game.\\nPlot.\\nAn outbreak of a highly contagious pathogen nicknamed the \"Green Flu\" (which causes extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells, loss of higher brain functions, and essential zombification of those who catch it) begins in Pennsylvania. Memorial walls—giving names and obituaries to those who have died in the infection—suggest that the game takes place in October 2009. Two weeks after the first infection, four immune survivors—Green Beret and Vietnam veteran William \"Bill\" Overbeck (voiced by Jim French), college student Zoey (voiced by Jen Taylor), district account manager Louis (voiced by Earl Alexander), and outlaw biker Francis (voiced by Vince Valenzuela)—make their way out of the city of Fairfield, only to discover that the infection is creating dangerous mutations in some of its hosts.\\nAfter narrowly avoiding the new types of infected, the survivors are alerted by a passing helicopter to an evacuation point at the roof of Mercy Hospital. Fighting their way through the city\\'s streets, subway, and sewers, they are rescued from the hospital\\'s roof by the pilot (voiced by Dennis Bateman), only to discover that he is infected. Zoey is forced to kill him, causing the helicopter to crash in an industrial district outside the city. Finding an armored delivery truck, the group uses it to reach the small town of Riverside. After encountering a paranoid and delirious man (voiced by Nathan Vetterlein) in the local church, they discover that the town is overrun and head to a boathouse for rescue. Contacting a small fishing vessel (owner voiced by John Patrick Lowrie), they are dropped at the city of Newburg across the river, finding much of it in flames. Resting in a greenhouse, the survivors are interrupted by a military C-130 Hercules passing overhead, leading them to believe that it will land at the city\\'s airport. The U.S. military had bombed the airport in an attempt to contain the infection, though the runway is partially intact, allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in the waiting C-130 (pilot voiced by Gary Schwartz).\\nLike the helicopter before it, this plane also crashes, and the survivors find themselves at the outskirts of the Allegheny National Forest. Following a series of train tracks, the group finally reaches a functioning but abandoned military outpost. After answering a radio transmission (soldier voiced by David Scully), they make their final stand against hordes of infected before a military APC arrives to supposedly transport them to Northeast Safe Zone Echo, one of the few remaining safe areas. Instead, they are detained in a military installation, where they learn that they are not immune and are actually asymptomatic carriers who have infected most of their rescuers. Meanwhile, the base is overthrown by a mutiny, attracting hordes of infected. The survivors escape via train and travel south at the insistence of Bill, who believes they can find long-term safety on the islands of the Florida Keys.\\nAt the portside town of Rayford in Georgia, they find a sailboat but must first raise a lift bridge powered by an aging generator to reach open waters. As the bridge raises, the generator gives out. Bill sacrifices himself to restart it so that the others may reach safety. While waiting for the horde to disperse, the three remaining members encounter the survivors from \"Left 4 Dead 2\". They agree to help the other survivors re-lower the bridge so that they can cross in their car. Louis, Zoey, and Francis then board their boat and set sail for the Florida Keys.\\nGameplay.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" is a first-person shooter in which the player takes control of one of four survivors; if human players are not available, the remaining survivors are filled by AI-controlled bots. They play through campaigns fighting off the infected—living humans who have been infected with a rabies-like virus that causes psychosis. The overarching goal is not to clear infected, but only to reach the next safe area alive. This is compounded by the presence of an \"AI Director\", who tracks each player\\'s current situation, and will add or remove items and infected in response; with the goal of maintaining constant tension and creating a new experience with each playthrough.\\nWhile a shooter, the game focuses largely on cooperation and teamwork, and thus eschews some \"realism\" conventions usual in other FPS games. Colored outlines of teammates are visible through walls to help players stick together and coordinate their movement. If a survivor\\'s health is depleted, they become incapacitated and can only be helped by another survivor, after which they continue playing with lower health. If they are incapacitated twice without healing, the third incapacitation will kill them.\\nDuring \"Campaign\" mode, if a survivor is killed, they will eventually respawn in a closet or small room, but must be freed by another survivor to rejoin the team. The AI will not open \"respawn closets\", so if all human player survivors are incapacitated, the level will restart. Survivors can share first-aid kits and pain pills, and heal each other. \"Left 4 Dead\" has friendly fire, increasing the need for caution and coordination around other survivors.\\nVia a quick menu, the survivors can communicate and organize with voice commands and callouts. Over 1,000 unique lines were recorded for each survivor. Additional communication of player actions is conveyed through lights; weapon-mounted flashlights and muzzle flashes help players determine when their companions are shooting, performing melee attacks, reloading or moving. (Due to control issues and the likelihood of players using a headset, the Xbox 360 version of \"Left 4 Dead\" omits the quick phrases feature.)\\nCampaigns.\\nAll original campaigns are divided into five levels, connected by safehouses; checkpoints where players can heal, re-arm and revive characters who were killed. Some levels are broken up with \"crescendo events\", which introduce a new obstacle before the survivors can continue moving. In the final chapter of each campaign, the players must defend a position from an onslaught of infected until rescue arrives. The four campaigns are: \"No Mercy\", a city culminating in a hospital skyscraper; \"Death Toll\", a small town and countryside; \"Dead Air\", a bombed city and an airport; and \"Blood Harvest\", a woodland and farm setting.\\nA two-level DLC campaign, \"Crash Course\", was released on September 29, 2009, set in the industrial outskirts between \"No Mercy\" and \"Death Toll\". The Sacrifice is a three-level campaign released on October 5, 2010, with an industrial port-side setting in Georgia. These new levels contain a number of alternate routes to follow with more supplies, helping to create a sense of non-linearity. Each campaign typically lasts between 20 and 75 minutes depending on the difficulty level. Both platform versions of the game utilize an achievement system.\\nWeapons.\\nEach player starts the game with a semiautomatic pistol. It is the only weapon with unlimited ammo, and the only weapon that can be used while incapacitated. (If a second pistol is found, the player can dual wield them.) At the beginning of each campaign, survivors can choose between a submachine gun and a pump-action shotgun. As the survivors progress through a campaign, more powerful weapons can be found; the full-auto assault rifle, a semi-automatic shotgun, and a scoped hunting rifle.\\nIn addition to firearms, a player can carry three other items: improvised grenades (either a Molotov cocktail, or a pipe bomb with a smoke alarm, designed to attract the infected); a first aid kit, which can be used to heal any survivor, and pain pills, which provide a temporary health boost. A melee attack can always be used to shove away any infected within reach. Also available are environmental weapons, such as gas cans, propane cylinders, and oxygen tanks, which explode when shot. These can be picked up and moved by survivors, but this blocks them from using other weapons at the same time. Rarely, there are strategically placed minigun turrets near crescendo events and finales.\\nInfected.\\nThe infected (voiced by experimental musician Mike Patton and voice actor Fred Tatasciore) are the enemies of \"Left 4 Dead\", and comparisons have been made with \\'zombies\\' from certain modern films, such as \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"28 Days Later\", and \"Quarantine\". An important distinction from the former is that the infected are, as cited in the game\\'s manual, living humans infected with a rabies-like pathogen; more similar to the latter two films, rather than undead zombies. While they are never seen eating humans, bite wounds and mutilation are often mentioned. In an interview with 1Up.com, designer Mike Booth commented on the concept of using a pathogen as an inspiration for the setting:\\nThe \"common infected\" are fast and agile, weak individually, but overwhelming in numbers. They display a special attraction to high-pitched sounds, such as car alarms and the beeping device attached to pipe bombs. They will often chase down these noises while ignoring lower-pitched, louder sounds, such as gunfire. They occasionally attack en masse, referred to as a \"horde\".\\nThere are five \"special\" or \"boss\" infected, whose mutations grant them special attacks. Each of the special infected have a distinctive sound, silhouette, and musical cue, making their presence easily recognizable by players. There are five special infected in \"Left 4 Dead\":\\nAI Director.\\nThe artificial intelligence of \"Left 4 Dead\" features a dynamic system for game dramatics, pacing and difficulty called the \"Director\". Instead of fixed spawn points for enemies, the Director places enemies and items in varying positions and quantities based upon each player\\'s current situation, status, skill and location, creating a new experience for each playthrough. The Director also creates mood and tension with emotional cues, such as visual effects, dynamic music, and character communication.\\nValve has termed this dynamic set-up \"procedural narrative\". In addition to the AI Director, there is a second Director that controls music. It was created as a way to keep the soundtrack interesting throughout the game. The music Director monitors what a player has experienced to create an appropriate mix. The process is client-side and done by a multi-track system. Each player hears their own mix, which is being generated as they play through the game; dead spectators will hear their teammates\\' mix.\\nA far simpler version of the A.I. Director was previously used for some key battles in \"\". Valve is looking for ways to apply the Director in their future games to make pacing and difficulty more dynamic.\\nGame modes.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" contains four game modes: campaign, versus, survival, and single-player. The cooperative campaign consists of up to four human-controlled survivors who attempt to make their way between safe rooms and eventually to rescue. In this mode, the special infected are controlled by the AI.\\nIn a versus campaign, there are two teams of four players each. They play each chapter as both survivor and infected, swapping sides after each round. The infected team are given vertical pathways, such as pipes and vines, which can be climbed and used for ambushes. Dead survivors do not respawn. If at least one player reaches the safehouse, the survivor team earns 100 points, as well as bonuses based on their health, and the health items still in their inventory. These points are multiplied by the chapter\\'s difficulty level, and the number of survivors who lived. If all survivors are killed, the survivor team only earns points from their progress through the chapter and the difficulty multiplier. The victor is decided by which team scores the highest during the campaign.\\nSurvival mode consists of a timed challenge where players try to survive as long as possible against a never-ending flood of the infected, added in April 2009 in the Survival Pack DLC. Single-player mode is similar to campaign mode, but played offline with three AI-controlled bots as the other survivors. On Xbox 360, other players can join the same console to turn single player into an offline co-op game. \"Left 4 Dead\" can also be played through a system link, or local area network. Players have also discovered a way to do splitscreen co-op with the PC version.\\nDevelopment.\\nDevelopment on \"Left 4 Dead\" started in mid-2005. Turtle Rock Studios aimed to create a horror film-inspired game that merges single player games\\' character-driven narrative structure with multiplayer games\\' social interaction and high replayability. The game was first revealed in the Christmas 2006 publication of \"PC Gamer UK\" with a six-page article describing a playthrough at Turtle Rock Studios headquarters. A teaser was released with \"The Orange Box\". The game was first playable at the Showdown 2007 LAN in San Jose and at QuakeCon 2007. Turtle Rock Studios announced \"Left 4 Dead\" on November 20, 2006, and was acquired by Valve on January 10, 2008, because of the game and long-standing relationship between the companies. The game opened up to pre-purchasing on Valve\\'s Steam system on October 15, 2008.\\nTo give \"Left 4 Dead\" significant exposure, Valve financed a $10-million marketing campaign for the game in the United States and Europe, with advertisements appearing on television, print, websites and outdoor placements in many cities. Valve also hosted photo contests called, \"Dude, where\\'s my thumb?\" offering copies of \"Left 4 Dead\" to people who submitted the best picture involving zombies or the outdoor advertising.\\nDevelopment.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" uses the 2008 version of Valve\\'s Source engine, with improvements such as multi-core processor support and physics-based animation to more realistically portray hair and clothing, and to improve physics interaction with enemies when shot or shoved in different body parts. Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in curved paths. Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up to allow for a greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information about the environment and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies have been added to the game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to focus attention on critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and vignetting to evoke tension and a horror-film look.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" underwent many phases of development; influenced by playtesting, Turtle Rock Studios removed many of the features that were originally in the game. In early development, there was another special infected, the \"screamer\", which had no attacks but upon spotting a survivor would run to a safe place and then emit a loud scream that attracted a horde of infected. This infected was removed, but its ability to attract the horde was incorporated into the Boomer\\'s vomit. A persistent merit/demerit system was envisioned to provide positive feedback for good behavior, such as aiding a fallen teammate; and negative feedback for poor behavior, such as shooting a teammate. This would provide a score to rank a player\\'s effectiveness as a teammate, but this system was removed late in the development of the game in favor of immediate, non-persistent feedback displayed in-game. Another significant element removed was a long introduction between campaigns; because the game is designed for replayability, it was difficult to hold the player\\'s attention for repeated viewings of cut scenes, so they were dropped in favor of a sparse narrative. In early development, the game began with a big city level with many routes for the survivors, but playtesters were confused when they began to play, and later they always chose the same route; ultimately Turtle Rock Studios cut the city maps into the first \"No Mercy\" and \"Dead Air\" campaigns.\\nCertain Affinity assisted Turtle Rock Studios with the Xbox 360 version of the game. The Xbox 360 version of \"Left 4 Dead\" has the same game modes as the PC version but has additional features such as support for split screen, allowing for two players to play offline and online from the same console, and System Link play. Split-screen mode can also be achieved on the PC version, but it requires console commands and may require the modification of controller configuration files; and it is not officially supported. Both versions of the game have a new matchmaking system to simplify the process of finding other players. This new server management system was met with a negative reaction from PC server operators, who, with this system, had very little control over their servers. This led to Valve releasing a series of patches that allowed server operators to remove their server from the matchmaking \"pool\" of servers or make private servers. Valve runs dedicated servers for both versions of the game.\\nPromotion.\\nTo promote the game and provide basic training to players before starting the game, Valve chose to develop a pre-rendered intro movie. This movie was released on Halloween and shows events prior to the beginning of the \"No Mercy\" campaign. Valve chose an intro movie over in-game training mechanics because they wanted the players to be immediately dropped into a zombie apocalypse. Valve later detailed in their official \"Left 4 Dead\" blog how they designed the movie, from a basic animatic in July 2008 to the final result for the launch of the game.\\nEarly access to the \"Left 4 Dead\" demo for people who pre-ordered the game began on November 6, 2008, for both Windows and Xbox 360. It gave users access to both online and single-player play in two \"scenes\" in one \"movie\" within the game. This promotion was being offered in addition to the ten percent savings for those who pre-order and applies to all Steam Windows pre-orders and all Windows and Xbox 360 pre-orders from GameStop and EB Games in North America. On November 11, the \"Left 4 Dead\" demo was made available to all Windows and Xbox 360 gamers worldwide. The \"Left 4 Dead\" demo was removed from the Xbox 360 Marketplace and Valve\\'s own Steam after the game\\'s release on November 18, 2008, however it is still available for those that played it.\\nThe demo had many server problems when it launched, primarily Valve\\'s strategy for server management which made it impossible to set up a dedicated private server with administrator controls. However, a stream of patches led to the availability of a server browser and basic private server functionality as well as Valve\\'s acknowledgment of player concerns. It appears that a patch released just before the game itself has resolved many of the connection issues that demo players were having.\\nOn May 1, 2009, the game was released freely via Steam as a one-day trial called \"Freaky Free Friday\". The trial was then extended to end on Saturday.\\nOn October 5, 2010, the price of the game via Steam was dropped to US$6.80, or a \"4-pack\" for $20.40, as a promotion coinciding with the release of \"The Sacrifice\" DLC.\\nRelease.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" went gold on November 13, 2008, and was released on November 18, 2008, in North America; and on November 21, 2008, in Europe to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the release of \"Half-Life\".\\nValve released a server patch in December 2008 to stop players on Xbox Live from using PC-style cheats. A spokesman from Valve said, \"The fix is designed to halt the cheating behavior on the dedicated servers, which accounts for the majority of the co-op and versus modes of play.\"\\nAfter release.\\nValve intended to support the PC version of the game through free content updates and the Xbox 360 version with DLC. On a podcast by Kotaku, writer Chet Faliszek divulged that an announcement regarding DLC for the PC and Xbox 360 would be released \"very soon\", and that the announcement was delayed by the holiday season. On February 5, 2009, Valve released details about the upcoming downloadable content pack. The two full campaigns of \"Death Toll\" and \"Dead Air\" for versus mode—which were previously unavailable—are included, as well as the survival game mode, where the survivors try to survive endless waves of the infected for as long as possible. On February 11, 2009, Valve announced that the downloadable content for the game would be free for both the Xbox 360 and PC; and on April 21, it was released. Survival mode shipped with 16 maps, 15 of them being modified portions of existing maps and one being a new lighthouse-themed level titled \"The Last Stand\". A \"Game Of the Year Edition\" of \"Left 4 Dead\" was released on the PC and Xbox 360 on May 12, 2009, with updates and new content included on the disc.\\nOn May 15, 2009, an open beta test for the Source Development Kit updated to support \"Left 4 Dead\" was started under the name of the \"Left 4 Dead Authoring tools\". This included a new set of plugins that allowed for users to import data from SketchUp, a free 3D modeling program, directly into the Hammer level editor for use in maps. The beta was concluded on June 25, 2009, with the full release of the Left 4 Dead authoring tools and corresponding server and matchmaking update to support custom maps. The update included a command line tool for packaging custom \"Left 4 Dead\" campaigns to ease distribution.\\nA sequel, announced at the 2009 E3 conference and was released November 17, 2009. Addressing concerns voiced by fans, Gabe Newell responded to an email from Kotaku explaining that despite the upcoming sequel, \"Left 4 Dead\" would continue to be supported and more content is planned in the coming months.\\nOn August 4, 2009, Valve announced the second DLC pack. It contains a new campaign called \"Crash Course\", set shortly after the events of the \"No Mercy\" campaign, where the Survivors try to get to a Truck Depot after the helicopter they were in crashed. It is available for co-op, versus and survival modes, with various tweaks to game mechanics, and containing new locations and character dialog. The DLC was announced to be released on September 29, 2009, on which date it was released for free for PC, but was accidentally released on Xbox Live at a higher price. The price was amended soon after, and all players who bought the DLC at the higher price were refunded.\\nOn November 9, 2009, a matchmaking update to allow for matchmaking between teams of four players in versus mode was released.\\nAn add-on campaign for \"Left 4 Dead 2\", \"The Passing\", featured the \"Left 4 Dead\" survivors meeting the new cast as part of a full campaign. The \"Left 4 Dead 2\" content was set for release in March 2010, however it was delayed until April 22, 2010. To connect the events in \"The Passing\" to that in \"Left 4 Dead\", Valve released another add-on in October 2010 for both \"Left 4 Dead\" and its sequel, entitled \"The Sacrifice\"; the events of the add-on take place before \"The Passing\" and tells how the \"Left 4 Dead\" survivors come to encounter the group from \"Left 4 Dead 2\", and how one sacrificed themselves for the safety of the others.\\nValve announced a 190-page digital comic that has been revealed in four parts in the weeks leading up to the release of \"The Sacrifice\". Part one was released on September 14, 2010, with a new part scheduled for release each week until \"The Sacrifice\"\\'s October 5 release. The comic is illustrated by Mike Oeming, the artist behind the Powers comic series, and tells the stories of the original four survivors, as well as the events leading up to the infection. The comic begins with Bill, having just sacrificed himself to save the others, taking on three tanks while severely wounded. It then cuts to the finale of Blood Harvest, which is revealed to be one week earlier. In \"The Sacrifice\" DLC, any player, whether playing as Bill or not, can choose to sacrifice themselves to allow the other survivors to complete the campaign.\\nIn March 2010, Valve announced that it would be bringing the Steam content platform to Mac OS X computers; along with it, they will be providing native versions of existing Valve games including \"Left 4 Dead\" and its sequel. The game was released for Mac OS X on October 27, 2010. \"Left 4 Dead\" support cross-platform play, allowing Mac players to play alongside PC players on the same servers, and is also part of the \"Steam Play\" cross-compatible and Steam Cloud titles, allowing a player that has purchased the game on one platform to download and play it on the other platform for free.\\nOverkill Software, the developers of \"\", a similar game to \"Left 4 Dead\" featuring four player co-operative gameplay, announced in June 2012 that it has worked with Valve to create a DLC level for \"Payday\" in the form of a map mirroring the \"No Mercy\" level from \"Left 4 Dead\", however, this DLC level is not canon to Left 4 Dead and does not lead to the infection that initiated the events in \"Left 4 Dead\".\\nOn August 20, 2015, an update for the game \"Zombie Army Trilogy\" was released, which imported the eight survivors from both \"Left 4 Dead\" games into \"ZAT\". Downloadable content for \"\" in 2021 included the four \"Left 4 Dead\" survivors as playable characters as part of its co-op mode.\\nThe character of Bill was introduced in the game \"Dead by Daylight\" in that game\\'s DLC in 2017, and was given an expanded lore scenario around his time in the Vietnam War in additional content released in 2021.\\nReception.\\nCritical reception.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" received highly positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, the game received an aggregated score of 89 out of 100 for both Xbox 360 and PC. \"IGN\" stated, \"It\\'s almost pitch perfect in how it captures the tension and the action of a Hollywood zombie movie\", and went on to describe it as, \"quite possibly the perfect co-op shooter.\" Giant Bomb commented that the Source engine was beginning to show its age, but praised the game\\'s use of lighting and filmic effects that gives the game world, \"a desolate, washed-out feeling\", as well as the realistic and emotive faces and the engrossing art direction. Eurogamer concluded that \"Left 4 Dead\" \"is another deeply professional, personality-filled and progressive take on the shooter from Valve.\" Both IGN and GameSpot praised the game\\'s replayability, but Gamespot criticized the \"limited map selection\" that could \"sometimes feel a bit repetitious\". GameSpy noted the lack of an overall narrative between the campaigns was disappointing. However, some reviewers praised its faithfulness to the zombie film genre, including the \"deliberately ambiguous\" back-story, and the amount of characterization and emotion brought by each of the four survivors. TeamXbox commented that clipping issues hurt the otherwise \"incredibly good\" visual experience. Hideo Kojima, creator of the \"Metal Gear\" series declared in an interview to 1UP.com that he was \"addicted to the game\", which was, in his view, one of the \"core titles made with movie-industry people that explore the depths of hi-def\".\\nSales.\\nOn October 28, 2008, Valve reported that preorders for \"Left 4 Dead\" had beaten those of \"The Orange Box\" by 95 percent after the Steam pre-order was launched. On November 21, 2008, the day of the game\\'s release in Europe, Valve issued a press release stating that \"Left 4 Dead\" had exceeded the pre-order numbers of \"The Orange Box\" by over 160 percent. The Xbox 360 version of \"Left 4 Dead\" was the seventh best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States, selling in excess of 629,000 copies. On February 3, Electronic Arts revealed that \"Left 4 Dead\" had sold 1.8\\xa0million copies, excluding Steam and worldwide sales figures. On March 26, Mike Booth revealed that the game had exceeded 2.5\\xa0million sales at retail during a presentation at the Game Developers Conference 2009. On September 24, 2009, Valve announced that almost 3\\xa0million copies of the game had been sold. On May 10, 2011, Doug Lombardi mentioned that the game and its sequel have each sold 3 million copies on the Xbox 360. On August 11, 2011, in a phone interview with Giant Bomb, Chet Faliszek said that the series has sold over 11 million units in total.\\nAwards.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" received recognition as one of the best multiplayer and PC games of 2008 from various organizations and gaming publications. The game was named the Best Multiplayer Game of 2008 by IGN, GameSpy, Spike TV, NoFrag and BAFTA; and as the \"Computer Game of the Year\" by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS), Spike TV, and Bit-tech. Other awards include \"Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay\" from the AIAS, Best Use of Sound for the PC and Best Shooting game overall from IGN, Father of All FPS from Nofrag, and the best Cooperative Multiplayer and Shooter of 2008 from GameSpot who also nominated it for Game of the Year.\\nLegacy.\\n\"Left 4 Dead\" and its sequel created a format for several games that followed that used the same four-player-versus-environment style of gameplay using artificial intelligence similar to the AI Director and encourages strong cooperation between players. Such \"Left 4 Dead\"-likes, according to \"Polygon\"s Josh Rios, included games like \\' and its , and \"Deep Rock Galactic\", but only about a decade after \"Left 4 Dead\"s release did a large number of titles in this genre emerge. The original \"Left 4 Dead\" developers, Turtle Rock Studios, released a spiritual successor titled \"Back 4 Blood\" in October 2021. Several \"Left 4 Dead\"-like games were announced ahead and during E3 2021, including \"Rainbow Six Extraction\", \"The Anacrusis\", \"Redfall\", \"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\" and \\'.

Purissima is the name of the town used as the setting for Ross Macdonald\\'s 1958 crime fiction novel \\'The Doomsters\\'.\\nHistory.\\nLocated on José María Alviso\\'s Rancho Cañada de Verde y Arroyo de la Purisima in a rural area four miles (6\\xa0km) south of Half Moon Bay, the village was one of the earliest settlements on the San Mateo County coast. The first European mention of the area was noted by Juan Crespí on the Portolá expedition of 1769. On October 27th they stopped at an \\nabandoned Torose village at the northern side of the stream. The local guides told them they have moved into the mountains. Crespí christened the stream San Ivo (Saint Ives). This is now remembered as California Historical Landmark #22. The First American village, as well as the creek, was renamed Purisima in 1786.\\nThe town was founded in an agricultural area in the early 1850s. Henry Dobbel (born in the sovereign state of Holstein, then in a personal union with Denmark, on July 1, 1829; died in Purissima on December 22, 1891) came to California via Cape Horn in 1845. After working at odd jobs, and even running a San Francisco restaurant, Dobbel married German Margaret Roverkamf-Schroeder (born near Hanover, Kingdom of Hanover, in 1831; died in Purissima on September 3, 1885). She had come to California via the Isthmus of Panama. They bought a farm in the East Bay. In the 1860s, they sold their farm and bought from John Purcell. They built a big, ornate house on the south bank of Purisima Creek. The house had two stories and 17 rooms; it boasted such innovations as gas lighting and running water. Dobbel employed 50 men who planted and harvested wheat, barley, and potatoes.\\nThe community was badly flooded by Purisima Creek in January 1862, the same month that much of northern California experienced its worst floods in history. Some fields and buildings were swept away. By the early 1870s, Purissima had a post office, several stores, a school, a one-story hotel known as Purissima House (owned by Richard Dougherty), and other buildings. The general store was built by Henry Husing. A lumber mill was constructed at the mouth of Purissima Canyon, to take advantage of the extensive redwood logging in the nearby Santa Cruz Mountains.\\nOil was discovered near the village in the 1880s on George Shout\\'s land. However, hopes of an oil boom were dashed when only 20 barrels a day were produced. The U.S. Geological Survey has noted later efforts to drill for oil in the area, usually resulting in minor production.\\nHenry Dobbel bought the general store, only to encounter financial difficulties when he extended credit to many of his customers. Then there were a series of crop failures, which eventually impacted Dobbel and the entire community. Henry Dobbel went bankrupt and sold his estate in 1890 to Henry Cowell. He remained in the area, however, and both he and his wife are buried in the village cemetery.\\nThe Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated from San Francisco to Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920, included a stop at Purissima, as noted on a U.S. Geological Survey\\'s Santa Cruz quadrangle map.\\nThe Purissima Post Office opened in 1868, only to be discontinued in 1869. Then, in 1872, it reopened and continued to serve the community until 1901.\\nSome buildings still remained as late as the 1930s, but the town was largely abandoned before World War II. The 1940 U.S. Geological Survey map shows a few buildings and notes the \"Purisima School.\" The 1943 map still shows the school. At that time, State Route 1 still passed directly through Purissima. Today, Highway 1 runs farther west of the original route. Verde Road runs north from Lobitos to Purisima Creek Road; this is actually the original alignment of Highway 1. According to the older maps, the school was located on the north side of what is now Verde Road, just east of Highway 1. The cemetery is in the woods bordered by Verde Road and Highway 1.\\nIn 1939, the Federal Writers Project guidebook for California noted, \"The village of Purisima, once a lively town on Jose Maria Alivso\\'s Rancho Canada y Arroyo de la Purisima, is ghostly and deserted now. Its weathered gray buildings stand among mosshung cypresses and eucalyptus trees, their windows broken, their stairs falling in, their facades rudely stuck with gay circus posters.\"\\nNo clear reasons have been found for the demise of the community; presumably its remote location led some residents to move to Half Moon Bay or other communities. All that remains of Purissima today is the cemetery (still noted on U.S. Geological Survey maps) and a part of the school. Several farms surround the site. There are numerous evergreen trees and heavy vegetation at the site. Dayna Chalif, who has explored the Purissima Cemetery and researched historic archives, wrote, \"Purissima was supposed to be the big town on the coast, [but it] was harder to get to.\" The failure of the Ocean Shore Railroad, which was intended to provide better access to the San Mateo County coast, may have hurt Purissima, although the village was later included on the original routing of Highway 1.\\nUntil the 1950s, however, much of the San Mateo County coastal area remained sparsely settled and the few surviving communities were relatively small. With the dramatic rise of housing costs along San Francisco Bay, there has been greater incentive to build along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the steady growth of Montara, Moss Beach, El Granada, Half Moon Bay, and Pescadero. This has done little for Purissima, which had long since vanished. Local newspaper articles have frequently mentioned that limited access to the area, primarily via Highways 1 and 92, has been a major factor in the slow growth. With the completion of the Devil\\'s Slide tunnel on Highway 1 in 2012, access to the coastal communities south of San Francisco has improved.\\nIn 2017, some restoration was begun of the site, with emphasis on cleaning up the cemetery, including access trails. Very little remains of the village besides the cemetery.\\nPurisima Creek.\\nThere is also the same named Purisima Creek, which passes near the town site. Purisima Creek Road follows the creek for some distance, toward the Santa Cruz Mountains to the east. There are some seasonal, sometimes spectacular falls along the creek. The creek was subsequently named \"Arroyo de la Purissima\" by later Spanish explorers.\\nCemetery.\\nOn September 15, 1868, John Purcell deeded some of his property to the citizens of Purissima for a burial ground. The Purissima Cemetery Association was created. Free burials were to be provided to Purissima residents. A Protestant church was to be built next to the cemetery.\\nToday, many of the gravestones in this cemetery are missing or broken. In the summer of 2005, Dayna Chalif transcribed the existing gravestones in the Purissima Cemetery, which was long largely overgrown with weeds, vines, and poison oak, making it very difficult to access. Recently (2017) a local company has cleared a path and advertises natural burial services on the site.\\nSee also.\\nList of ghost towns in California'),\n ('8036198',\n  'Imperial Records (1900)',\n  'The earliest Imperial Records was a short-lived United States based company of the 1900s (decade), producing single-sided lateral cut gramophone records.

Historically, these lines were operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in Norway and the Swedish State Railways (SJ) in Sweden, but in 1996 the operations, but not the infrastructure, were transferred to the new company Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB), a joint venture between LKAB, NSB and SJ, and its Norwegian subsidiary Malmtrafikk (MTAS). At the time, the line was using El 15 and Dm3 locomotives.\\nIn 1998, LKAB estimated a steady 35% increase in iron ore production until 2005, and requested that the governments grant sufficient funding to upgrade the lines from to maximum permitted axle load. Combined with new locomotives, this would give increased efficiency in hauling the ore from the mines. The upgrade was estimated to cost 180 million Norwegian krone (NOK) for the Ofoten Line alone.\\nIn March 1998, LKAB awarded the contract to build 750 new 100-tonne hopper cars to Transnet of South Africa. In August, an agreement was reached whereby LKAB would pay NOK\\xa0100 million of the NOK\\xa0130 million needed to upgrade the Ofoten Line. The contract to deliver 18 locomotives was signed with Adtranz Switzerland on 15 September 1998. In 1999, LKAB bought SJ\\'s and NSB\\'s share in MTAB.\\nThe first two sections were delivered by Adtranz in August 2000, and was subjected to intensive tests before the manufacture of the rest of the series. Commissioning concluded in December 2000, the locomotive started regular service on 10 January 2001, and started operation with the new hopper cars and axle load on 7 March 2001. In May 2001, Bombardier Transportation took over Adtranz. Bombardier delivered the rest of the Iore series from 2002 to 2005. In March 2004, LKAB decided not to purchase additional hopper cars from Transnet, and instead purchased 750 heavier cars from K-Industrier. Since 1969, the ore trains have been using the Soviet SA3 coupler. However, LKAB wanted to also try Janney couplers (also known as AAR coupler, used in much heavier trains in USA and South Africa), as the SA3 couplers were not much tested with the new weights. While the first pair of locomotives had Janney couplers, the rest of the locomotives were equipped with SA3 couplers to handle the existing hopper cars, and the cars bought from K-Industrier. The locomotives and Transnet wagons with Janney couplers were retrofitted with SA3 couplers. In 2004, the El 15 locomotives were sold to Hector Rail.\\nOn 23 August 2007, LKAB ordered another four twin units, with delivery in 2010 and 2011, and costing €52 million. These will replace all remaining Dm3 locomotives by 2011, and LKAB convert all the ore trains to 68 cars. This will increase the capacity from 28 to 33 million tonnes per year, and at the same time reduce the number of departures per day from 21 to 15.\\nThe name Iore is a mixture between the term Iron ore, and the fictional character Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh, spelled I-or in Swedish.\\nSpecifications.\\nThe Iore class was a cold-adapted and heavy-haul derivation from Adtranz\\'s Octeon modular electric locomotive platform, which was launched in 1998 on the basis of Adtranz\\'s latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel, Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform, the type designation TRAXX H80\\xa0AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family by the time of the second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna.\\nEach Iore consists of twin units with one driver\\'s cab at each. They normally operate in fixed units of two, making a pair capable of hauling a ore train. Technically an Iore section is also capable to operate as single locomotive, an option that is seldom used in operation. The units are fed with via a pantograph. The power is transformed and then converted via a single water-cooled gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor based converter per bogie. The converters belong to the \"Camilla\" family, which was developed by ABB\\'s Swiss branch as successor for its oil-cooled converters, and found previous use in the FS Class E464. The converters operate independently, with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure. The converters consist of seven line-replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs. Each locomotive has six three-phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors, each rated at and each powering a single axle. This gives a Co′Co′ wheel arrangement. The tractive effort of each locomotive is and the maximum dynamic braking effort is . There is also a boost function, allowing a temporary traction effort of . The units are capable of in single runs, with empty trains and with loaded trains.\\nThe locomotives are long, tall and wide. The distance between the bogie centers is and the bogie wheel-base is . The wheel diameter is when new and when worn. Each locomotive weighs , of which is electrical equipment. Each locomotive has of dead weight to increase the locomotive\\'s weight to the maximum axle weight, and further weight increase has been achieved by making the walls wide with armored steel. The extra wall thickness also provides for increased structural strength, to withstand collisions with snowdrifts and elk. The sides of the walls were built as flat as possible to reduce the sticking of blowing snow and ice formation.\\nThe auxiliary system is powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400\\xa0volt system. The locomotive is designed with an open system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver\\'s chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked in such a way that it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.\\nOperation.\\nLKAB operates iron ore mines in Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget in Norrbotten County, Sweden. Most of the output is transported by rail to the ice-free Port of Narvik, a route named the Northern Circuit. A minority of the ore is transported to Luleå on the Southern Circuit. Located on the Baltic Sea, ore is shipped to Baltic customers, or delivered to furnaces operated by SSAB in Luleå and Oxelösund. The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are long, including the branch to Svappavaara, with the route from Kiruna to Narvik being , and from Malmberget to Luleå being . Operations are handled by LKAB\\'s subsidiary Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB) in Sweden, and Malmtrafikk (MTAS) in Norway. As of 2010, six pairs of the first batch Iore locomotives operate 11 to 13 trains daily in each direction on the Northern Circuit, and the remaining three pairs of the first batch operate five to six trains on the Southern Circuit. The four pairs of second-batch locomotives will replace Dm3 locomotives on the Northern Circuit by 2011.\\nThe trains hauled by Iore are 68 cars long and weigh . From Riksgränsen on the national border to the Port of Narvik, the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate. The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border. Although the trains and hopper cars are all owned by LKAB, the line is owned by the Swedish Transport Administration and Bane NOR. The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are also used by passenger and container trains.'),\n ('8036296',\n  'Red Bluhm',\n  'Harvey Fred Bluhm (June 27, 1894 – May 7, 1952), nicknamed \"Red\", was a Major League Baseball player for the Boston Red Sox.

Paper was used to make money, Buddhist texts, and medical and history books. The government encouraged dak cultivation and paper production, and dak was planted countrywide in the 12th century. Often called Goryeoji, hanji became famous in Asia for its strength and luster, and became a heavy trade item to China.\\nThe Goryeo period is famous for two major landmarks in Korean printmaking and paper history. One was the carving of the Tripitaka Koreana onto over 80,000 wooden blocks, which contain no errors and are still extant in their original home at Haeinsa, a Buddhist temple in Gyeongsangnam-do. It was carved twice, due to its destruction by Mongol invasions in 1232; the final version was completed in 1251. The second accomplishment was the printing in 1377 of Jikji, a guide for students of Buddhism, and the world\\'s oldest extant book printed using metal movable type. Printed onto hanji, it is housed today in the National Library of France, and displays proof of movable metal type well before Gutenberg\\'s time.\\nJoseon period.\\nThe beginning of the Joseon period (1392–1910) saw continued flourishing of the hanji industry as paper permeated daily lives of Koreans through books, household items, and popular items such as fans and tobacco pouches. From the start of the Joseon period in an effort to promote austerity, artificial flowers that had been made from wax and silk were replaced by paper versions. Later, paper flowers were also used to replace other versions for Buddhist rites and festivals.\\nVariations of hanji became common, such as colored paper, and paper made from mixed fibers including pine bark, rice straw, and bamboo. This came partly from a need to find new materials beyond dak due to the huge demand for books. The government created an administrative agency devoted to paper production, and also supplied troops with paper armor, which was waterproof, a good insulator, and provided protection against arrows and swords. Oiled hanji was used to make greenhouses c. 1450 because the paper, made of natural materials, could control temperature, humidity, and light effectively. However, the Joseon government pressured Buddhist monks to increase their production of hanji that they were already making for Buddhist scriptures since the 15th century.\\nAs the final blow to hanji, western methods of paper mass production were introduced in 1884.\\nAfter liberation.\\nIn the 1970s, the New Village Movement that aimed to modernize Korea rapidly also led to further decimation of the hanji industry, as it eradicated traditional straw-thatched homes that used hanji to cover floors, walls, ceilings, windows, and doors. The most recent threat to the Korean paper industry is the rise of inexpensive paper made in China, where labor costs and overhead are significantly lower than in Korea.\\nAs of 2009, twenty-six hanji mills remain operational in South Korea. They make hanji for artists, calligraphers, conservators, temples, and laypeople.\\nManufacturing process.\\nMaterials.\\nThe two materials mainly used when making Hanji is the paper mulberry (called the Dak tree) and the aibika. More than 6 steps of the manufacturing process deal with mending and preparing these two materials (Seo).\\nThe paper mulberry is a commonly grown plant in Asia, growing in the feet of mountains that gets a lot of sunlight, reaching a growth height of usually 3 meters. In Korean history, people used the fibers from these trees to make clothes, and they began to use it as the source for paper during the Goryeo dynasty. The Joseon dynasty, which came after Goryeo, recommended people to grow more of these mulberry trees.\\nThe aibika usually finishes growing in October. Their roots contain a slimy mucus (called Dak Pul) which helps hold the paper together and give viscosity to the bark.\\nProcess.\\nAncient Koreans usually started making Hanji during the winter, because the mucus from \"Abelmoschus manihot\" became easily fermented due to the summer heat. Ancient Koreans believed that it was important to choose a good day with a nice sky to start making Hanji, and often gave religious rituals to the spirits in order to wish for a favorable condition and a smooth process.\\nThe process of making Hanji differs by what ingredients the Hanji makers choose, and what methods of sheet formation they take to make the final product. However, the most traditional and basic process follows eight steps:\\nThe overall process of making Hanji was very strenuous. One had to dedicate all of his or her life to making Hanji, and traditional Hanji makers would say “I will not let my son be a container man (the person who strains the fiber through a bamboo screen) even if I am driven to the worst”. It requires a lifelong practice to create perfect Hanji, and this is the reason why Hanji holds a great cultural value in Korea. These days, people use various technology to improve the process. For example, the Hanji makers use a heated stainless steel drum, brushing every part of the paper. This is the method that they take to dry the papers evenly, which is adapted from how traditional Hanji makers dried them on the floor of a warm room.\\nCharacteristics of Hanji.\\nDurability.\\nHanji is a very reputable paper among Asians, and it is famous for its durability. The fact that other historical print papers have to be preserved in special containers when Hanji papers can still be displayed in museums proves this fact. The oldest text made of Hanji currently existing in Korea, Muggujungwang, is still well preserved after about 800 years.\\nVentilation.\\nHanji is a good ventilator, but it also acts as an insulator. Traditional Koreans covered their wooden doors with Hanji because it would cool down in the summer and make them warm during winter.\\nWaterproofness.\\nIn March 2006, there was a lamp festival in Paris, France. Many sizes and colors of lamps were lighted in the Boulogne park. Soon after the festival started, there was a sudden rain, and people panicked. They were worried that all the lamps would turn off. However, lamps made out of traditional Hanji did not turn off. It did not let the rain through, protecting candle lights within, and it portrayed one of the many advantages of Hanji.\\nScientific principles.\\nThe bark from mulberry trees contain lignin and holocellulose, which contribute to the durability of Hanji. Ordinary paper has a pH level of 4~5.5, meaning that it is acidic. If paper has a low pH level (more acidic), it is completely decomposed in 100 years. Hanji, however, uses Hibiscus Manihot, which has a pH level of 7 and does not get dismantled easily.\\nUse of Hanji.\\nAncient uses.\\nEver since paper was first introduced to the commoners in ancient Koreans, its uses have been adapted into various and unique ways. Hanji was used to help people in the daily lives. They covered their door frame with Hanji and controlled the room temperature. The high social class people, called Yangbans, recorded various documents on Hanji. This is one of the main reasons why Korea\\'s ancient records are well preserved. It was one of the main export products that Korean dynasties used in trading (Seo). Another unique usage of Hanji is that people made armors out of Hanji. Even though Hanji is just a paper, it was very durable and tough. It was waterproof, and did not rip easily. There is a record in Korea saying that people made armors and suits with Hanji, and called them \"Jigap\".\\nHanji art and craft forms.\\nThere are two divisions of hanji art: two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Two-dimensional hanji art uses paper of various colors to create an image in a similar format as a painting. However, the paper itself is folded and crumpled to make the image stick up from the paper it is adhered to. People make various shapes with Hanji and frame it to exhibit on their wall. Three-dimensional hanji art is similar to paper mache, in that it can make sculptural objects that may stand unsupported. Traditional hanji craft forms include jiho, jido, and jiseung. Jiho is a method that uses hanji scraps soaked in water and then added to glue, making a clay-like paste that can be molded into lidded bowls. Jido is the craft of pasting many layers of hanji onto a pre-made frame, which can be made into sewing baskets and trunks. Ancient Koreans commonly put their sewing materials in small boxes decorated with colorful Hanji (\"Hanji Crafting\"). Jiseung is a method of cording and weaving strips of hanji to make a wide array of household goods, including trays, baskets, mats, quivers, shoes, washbasins, and chamberpots. Other than these, Hanji was made into various flowers to decorate Buddhist temples (\"Hanji Crafting\").\\nCitations.\\nCleaning the Bark. Doopedia.

He accepted this duty happily and in between engaged himself in prayers. He dispensed with his duties well and also attended the discourse of Baba Freed Ganj-e-Shakar. He did not partake of a single morsel from food (langer), kept fasts and went to the jungle and ate wild berries and leaves. He did his duties for 12 years. He prayed continuously and his abstentions were never disrupted. Frequent and continuous fasting and eating leaves and wild food made him weak. When his mother came back again and saw him, she complained to his brother (Baba Fareed) about his weakness. Baba Fareed called upon him and asked the reason. Sabir Pak replied, “You ordered me to distribute the food and not to partake from it”. Baba Fareed embraced him happily and remarked, “He is sabir (Patient)”.

This is a frame tale based on a putative production of \"No, No, Nanette\" (written in 1925 by the prolific Caesar, Otto Harbach, and Vincent Youmans); \"Tea for Two\" being a number inserted into the original \"Nanette\". \"Crazy Rhythm\" is presented in this film as a demonstration for backers of the production-to-be. Thus, it has come to be associated with the popular \"Tea\" and \"Nanette\", while \"Here\\'s Howe\" is largely forgotten. Day and Nelson also recorded \"Crazy Rhythm\" on the album \"Tea for Two\"—not a soundtrack but a distinct studio recording in which Nelson does a tap solo, not seen or heard on film.\\nBing Crosby recorded the song in 1956 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set \"The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56)\" issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009.\\nTony Bennett recorded the song for his 1957 album \"The Beat of My Heart\".

They are used on some small vehicles such as riding lawn mowers and motorized golf carts. They are also used on heavy equipment such as backhoes, which are required to operate on sites such as building demolition, where risk of tire punctures is high. Tires composed of closed-cell polyurethane foam are also made for bicycles and wheelchairs. They are also commonly found on wheelbarrows which may be used for yard work or construction.\\nAdvantages &amp; disadvantages.\\nThe main advantage of airless tires is that they do not go flat. Other advantages are that airless tires need to be replaced less frequently, resulting in savings. Heavy equipment outfitted with airless tires will be able to carry more weight and engage in more rugged activities. \\nAirless tires generally have higher rolling resistance and provide somewhat less suspension than similarly shaped and sized pneumatic tires. Other problems for airless heavy equipment tires include dissipating the heat buildup that occurs when they are driven. Airless tires are often filled with compressed polymers (plastic) rather than air, or can be a solid molded product.\\nAirless tires are attractive to cyclists, as bicycle tires are much more vulnerable to punctures than motor vehicle tires. The drawbacks to airless tires depend on the use. Heavy equipment operators who use machinery with solid tires may complain of fatigue. Bicycle riders who use airless tires may complain that the tire is harder than a comparable pneumatic tire, however, only anecdotal evidence suggests that airless tires may cause broken spokes on a bicycle wheel. Any airless tire will be heavier than the rubber tire it is meant to replace.\\n, airless tires are not popular with hardcore off-roaders as those vehicles often need to travel long distances at highway speeds. They are unstable, cause severe vibrations (passenger discomfort) and therefore potential for drivers to lose vehicle control at speeds above 80 km/h.\\nInstallation of airless tires depends on the use. Heavy equipment will need special equipment to mount, but an airless bicycle tire can be mounted with little or no effort. Solid airless lawnmower tires come pre-installed on the wheel, allowing quick installation.\\nExamples.\\nMany bicycle-sharing systems use these tires to reduce maintenance.\\nIn 2005, Michelin started developing an integrated tire and wheel combination, the \"Tweel\" (derived from \"tire\" and \"wheel,\" which, as the name \"Tweel\" suggests, are combined into one new, fused part), which operates entirely without air. Michelin claims its \"Tweel\" has load carrying, shock absorbing, and handling characteristics that compare favorably to conventional pneumatic tires. However, the tire has a lot of vibration when driving over . Therefore the tire is only available for golf carts, ATV\\'s and skid steer vehicles. In 2019 however Michelin and GM announced their goal of making a new airless tire for passenger vehicles available in 2024. \\nThe automotive engineering group of the mechanical engineering department at Clemson University is developing a low energy loss airless tire with Michelin through the NIST ATP project.\\nResilient Technologies and the University of Wisconsin–Madison\\'s Polymer Engineering Center are creating a \"non-pneumatic tire\", which is basically a round polymeric honeycomb wrapped with a thick, black tread. The initial version of the tire is for the Humvee and is expected to be available in 2012. It is also the first group to make a commercially available mass-produced airless tire after its acquisition by Polaris, albeit only as coupled with their vehicle.

She was born in Bessemer, Alabama on April 19, 1914. When better economic conditions did not appear for their family when they moved to Birmingham, her grandparents urged her parents to move north to Michigan. At 8, she moved to Detroit, Michigan, with her family. There, her father established a tailor shop that was supported by Detroit automotive workers. They occupied a neighborhood that was racially diverse.\\nEducation.\\nBrown enrolled at the Bishop School when her parents moved the family to Detroit in 1922 and she had her first experiences with racial discrimination at the school. A German classmate called her \"schwarze\" or \"black woman,\" using negative connotations.\\nIn 1931, she graduated from Cass Technical High School and entered Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. She originally intended to study medicine, but found it too difficult to look at the medical cadavers. She quickly changed her concentration to sociological work. During her time at Fisk, she studied sociology with renowned sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and received an A.B. degree. To manage college expenses Brown worked at a Detroit Urban League summer camp for underprivileged children. Brown was known for being particularly active in campus political movements as a student (1931-1935). This commitment was inspired by her strong reaction to the lynching of a young black man accused of rape in Columbia, Tennessee. Her actions on campus indicate her lifelong commitment to social justice.\\nFollowing graduation, Brown returned to Detroit where she worked from 1941 to 1946 as a policewoman in the Detroit Police Department\\'s Women\\'s Division. Many of her cases involved criminal law. This inspired her to attend Wayne State University\\'s law school, she would pass the bar examination two weeks after her graduation in 1948. Though she did not focus on criminal law during her time in school, Brown remained interested in this pursuit.\\nLegal career.\\nUpon graduation from Fisk University in 1935, Brown took advantage of the need for social workers created by the 1929 economic crash. For another five years, she assisted the homeless of Detroit deal with the effects of the Great Depression.\\nAt 37, Brown worked as a fines lawyer in Detroit. She made a comfortable living and resided with her mother.\\nFollowing her work as the special associate general counsel of the US Post Office, she moved to Los Angeles. She opened a small practice there and practiced law until her return to Detroit in 1970.\\nBrown was involved in several civil rights and community building organizations. Brown worked with the NAACP, YWCA, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and the New Calvary Baptist Church.\\nPolitical career and involvement.\\nBrown\\'s political involvement began during her time at Fisk University. As a student she participated in demonstrations and was praised by writer Edward T. Clayton for her \"willingness to battle injustice.\"\\nIn 1950 and 1951, she ran for a seat on the Michigan State Senate but was defeated. This seat had been up for special election after senator Wilkowski had been accused of election fraud. Her experience in these two campaigns allowed her to make more competitive decisions in her 1952 race. She went door to door and sent trucks around Detroit to spread her message to voters, this campaign was based on her desire to improve hospital, social services, and to decrease racial inequality.\\nBrown\\'s campaign victory in 1952 allowed her to serve two terms (1953-1956). At the time, a Michigan State Senate term was about two years. She served as the state senator for the 2nd District during her first term and served for the 3rd District during her second term. Throughout her time in the Senate, she worked on committees for welfare, public utilities, and health. Brown fought strongly for civil rights and introduced several bills that aided their expansion in Michigan. One such bill increased punishments given to restaurants and hotels that were racially discriminatory from $25 to $100. Another, introduced in 1956, ordered the removal of licenses of business that discriminated on the basis of race. Brown is also noted to be a women\\'s rights activist, as she worked to curb the distribution of pornography through the mail. Newspapers hailed her as the \"champion of the underprivileged.\"\\nAt times, Brown clashed with her colleagues in the Democratic Party. Her devotion to issues like education, civil rights, health, and labor often challenged more conservative members of her party. She made the decision to change her district in her 1956 run for office, challenging another Democrat who was quite popular. She told constituents not to vote for representatives who would not openly support the Civil Rights Movement, costing her the support of the United Auto Workers Union and the Democratic Party.\\nShe supported Dwight Eisenhower when he ran for re-election in 1956 over the Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson, because of his views on civil rights. The same year, Brown attempted to win a seat in Congress. Her candidacy in the Democratic Primary for US representative from Michigan\\'s 1st District was announced following her 1956 selection as the Outstanding Woman Legislator of the year. Ultimately, Brown lacked the support of her party in the election. She would lose by 6,491 votes. In 1957, she was appointed as the special associate general counsel of the US Post Office, where she would work until the Democrats returned to power in 1960. Tracy was the first black woman to hold this post. Later, Brown served as executive director of the President\\'s Committee on Government Contracts, a committee formed to regulate fair employment practices by government contractors. Following ten years in private practice, she returned to Detroit (1970) and joined the Michigan Employment Security Commission as a referee.\\nIn popular culture.\\nA portrait of Brown, painted by Detroit artist Telitha Cumi Bowens, was included in the 1988/89 exhibit \"Ain\\'t I A Woman\" at the Museum of African American History, Detroit.

He was a key member of the South African team that won the 2007 Rugby World Cup and part of the team that won the 2019 Rugby World Cup, with Os Du Randt (1995 and 2007) being the first two time Springbok winning player. \\nSteyn was a key member of the Springboks team that beat the British and Irish Lions in 2009. He is known for his long distance kicking ability and strong tackling.\\nClub career.\\nSharks (2007–2009).\\nIn his debut season of Super 14 rugby for the Sharks, Steyn was selected on the right wing, however, was moved to fullback when Percy Montgomery was injured. He played as the last line of defence until Percy Montgomery returned for the game against the Blues in Round 11, and was moved to fly-half for this game.\\nRacing Metro (2009–2012).\\nIn April 2009, Steyn signed a two-year contract with French Top 14 club Racing Métro 92 for an estimated €750,000 per season.\\nSharks (2012–2013).\\nSteyn rejoined The Sharks by signing a 3-year deal on 29 May 2012. Back with his old team, Steyn played in the Sharks\\' final two league matches of the 2012 Super Rugby season, helping them to make the finals series. Steyn was not available to them for the knock-outs due to his late entry into the squad. The Sharks went on to lose in the final to The Chiefs.\\nThe player made his return for the Sharks in the 2013 Super Rugby competition, captaining the side in the first few matches in the absence of regular skipper, Keegan Daniel. Steyn struggled with form early on in Super Rugby, but as the season progressed, he began to regain the form that first earned him Springbok honours. Once again though, Steyn was injured in the Sharks league match against the Highlanders in Dunedin, which they lost. Steyn would have to wait until the Currie Cup semi-final of 2013 against the Free State Cheetahs to make his next appearance. He was subbed early on in the match, but was again selected for the final against DHL Western Province. Steyn\\'s contributions on attack were good, but it was his immense defense that really marked his successful comeback, and helped the Sharks to Currie Cup victory in 2013. After only 2 matches back, Steyn was not selected for the Springbok end of year tour in 2013.\\nToshiba Brave Lupus (2014–2016).\\nOn 3 June 2014 Steyn signed a two-year deal with Japanese club Toshiba Brave Lupus.\\nMontpellier (2016–2020).\\nIn February 2016, Steyn joined French club Montpellier Hérault Rugby.\\nInternational career.\\nAfter playing only ten matches for the in the 2006 Currie Cup Premier Division (at fly-half), Steyn was, at 19 years old, selected to represent South Africa in the Northern Hemisphere touring squad by national coach Jake White. He debuted at wing against Ireland, he scored a try on his debut. In his next international match he was moved to fullback against England, scoring a long range drop-goal, from his own half. Steyn has shown to possess superb goal kicking qualities as well.\\nSteyn kicked two drop goals in the 2007 Tri Nations opener against Australia at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, to win the game for the Springboks. One of these, a 42-metre effort from a fielded clearance kick next to the sideline, and another three minutes from time next to the posts about 30 metres out.\\nIn South Africa\\'s first game at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, their centre Jean de Villiers got injured. Steyn replaced him, playing only his second game at professional level at inside centre, but he made a break on first touch of the ball and his inclusion sparked the Springboks to a 37–0 second half demolition of Samoa.\\nOn 24 September 2007 Steyn was cited to appear before a disciplinary hearing for allegedly biting Tongan winger Joseph Vaka during the Springboks v. Tonga 2007 Rugby World Cup game on 22 September. (Match report). Both players were sent to the sinbin in the 60th minute for an off-the-ball incident. He was subsequently cleared of the charge, due to insufficient evidence and Vaka conceding that the apparent \"bite mark\" could have been received during normal play.\\nSteyn was the starting inside centre for the Springboks in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final, he made a fantastic break that resulted in a penalty for the Boks and also converted one himself later on in the game. He is therefore the youngest player to win a Rugby World Cup.\\nIn the Springboks\\' final match of the 2009 Tri Nations against New Zealand, his last match with the Boks before his departure for France, he converted three penalties from within his own half of the field; he is believed to be the first player ever to do so in a Test match.\\nReaching his 50th test cap against Argentina in Cape Town in 2012, Steyn is the youngest South African to reach the milestone. Steyn was injured during the 2012 Rugby Championship, missing the final 2 matches, along with the Currie Cup, and the end of year tour to the UK.\\nSteyn was re-called for South Africa for the 2017 series against France due to the injuries of Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard, after a 3-year absence from international rugby.\\nIn 2019, Steyn was again called up as part of the South African team to play in the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan and became one of the few players to have won two World Cups, the second only for South Africa.'),\n ('8036506',\n  'River Washburn',\n  'The River Washburn is a river in Yorkshire, England.

The name is thought to come from an Old English personal name \"Walc\", not otherwise recorded, so means \"stream of a man named Walc\".\\nCourse.\\nThe river\\'s source is at Washburn Head, just south of Stump Cross Caverns and from there flows southwards via Thruscross Reservoir, Blubberhouses, Fewston Reservoir, Swinsty Reservoir and Lindley Wood Reservoir before joining the River Wharfe just north-west of Pool-in-Wharfedale.\\nReservoirs.\\nThe Washburn has been dammed to a series of four reservoirs, all built to supply water to the city of Leeds. The lower three (Lindley Wood, Swinsty and Fewston) were built at the end of the 19th century, while the fourth, Thruscross, was delayed until the 1960s. Fewston and Swinsty Reservoirs have a surface area of around and a combined length of and Thackray Beck and Spinksburn Beck are major tributaries flowing into these reservoirs. Capelshaw Beck is the main tributary flowing into Thruscross reservoir.\\nGeology.\\nWhere the valley has not been flooded to make reservoirs, the sides are \\'V\\' shaped. The valley floor consists of solid Millstone Grit overlain with till drift. The drainage can be described as slowly permeable and seasonally waterlogged. The bedrock is covered with fine loam over clay soils and some peat soils at higher elevations on the fringe of the moorland.\\nGeography.\\nThe river valley has grassland that is intensively managed for livestock. There are also a range of field sizes, bounded by stonewalls often reinforced with post and wire fencing plus some post and rail fencing. There are very large forestry conifer plantations around the reservoirs as well as at Beecroft Moor Plantation, with conifer shelterbelts at Carlhow Ridge Plantation. Deciduous tree clumps can be found around settlements. Ancient Semi-Natural woodland can still be seen at Blubberhouses, Folly Hall Wood, Hanging Wood and Ellers Wood. There is evidence of past quarrying of local stone for buildings and walls.

His father, Liang Xianxi (梁咸熙), was a Xiucai in the Qing dynasty. He was educated at Tsinghua College in Beijing from 1915 to 1923. He went on to study at Colorado College and later pursued his graduate studies at Harvard and Columbia Universities. At Harvard, he studied literary criticism under Irving Babbitt, whose New Humanism helped shape his conservative literary tenets.\\nAfter his return to China in 1926, he began a long career as a professor of English at several universities, including Peking University, Tsingtao University, and Jinan University. He also served as the editor of a succession of literary supplements and periodicals, including the famous \"Crescent Moon Monthly\" (1928–1933). During this period he published a number of literary treatises which showed the strong influence of Babbitt and demonstrated his belief that human life and human nature are the only proper subjects for literature. The best known among these are \"The Romantic and the Classical\", \"Literature and Revolution\", \"The Seriousness of Literature\", and \"The Permanence of Literature\". In each of these treatises, he upheld the intrinsic value of literature as something that transcends social class and strongly opposed using literature for propagandist purposes. These pronouncements and his dislike for the excessive influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Romanticists in China triggered a polemic war between him and Lu Xun and drew the concerted attacks of leftist writers. His major works as a translator included James Barrie\\'s \"Peter Pan\", George Eliot\\'s \"Silas Marner\" and \"Mr. Gilfil\\'s Love Story\", and Emily Brontë\\'s \"Wuthering Heights\".\\nIn 1949, to escape the civil war, Liang fled to Taiwan where he taught at Taiwan Normal University until his retirement in 1966. During this period, he established himself as a lexicographer by bringing out a series of English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries. His translation works included George Orwell\\'s \"Animal Farm\" and Marcus Aurelius\\' \"Meditations\".\\nLiang is now remembered chiefly as the first Chinese scholar to single-handedly translate the complete works of Shakespeare into Chinese. This project, which was first conceived in 1930, was completed in 1967. He then embarked on another monumental project – that of writing a comprehensive history of English literature in Chinese, which was completed in 1979 and consists of a three-volume history and a companion set of \"Selected Readings in English Literature\" in Chinese translation, also in three volumes. Liang’s literary fame rests, first and foremost, on the hundreds of short essays on familiar topics, especially those written over a span of more than four decades (1940–1986) and collected under the general title of \"Yashe Xiaopin\", now available in English translation under the title \"From a Cottager’s Sketchbook\".'),\n ('8036517',\n  'Blenheim High School',\n  'Blenheim High School is a secondary school located at Longmead Road, Epsom, Surrey, England, that opened in 1997.

It was HUSS Maschinenfabrik's first ride model, debuted in 1969. It is not manufactured by the company anymore, but there are a handful of known units left around the world. The ride rotates in a circle, and the arms swing out, and then come in. They keep on doing this during the ride, in bigger and bigger increments until the very end, where they all swing out, using pneumatic pressure. Most parks require riders to be 42 inches tall to ride; anyone under 48 inches tall must ride with an adult.\\nSeats.\\nThis ride has 14 seats which can fit two people at most. These rides have a metal bar that goes over both, or single riders. Some rides also have a seatbelt for extra protection, and there are no seat dividers.\\nAppearance.\\nThe ride itself looks circular with the bottom of it smaller than the top. Some of these rides have lights on them, but very little theming to them.\\nSuccessors and Similar Rides.\\nHUSS.\\nThe Bee Bee is a newer version of the Huss Swing Around that is usually themed relating to bumble bees. In this version of the ride, the ride features 10 cars that seat two passengers each which are restrained by an overhead lap bar. The noticeable difference between the Bee Bee and the Swing Around is the Swing Around features 14 cars where passengers are restrained by a lap bar which acts as a handle for passengers to hold onto throughout the duration of the ride.\\nMoser Rides.\\nThe Dactylus is very similar to the Huss Swing Around except the ride only features eight cars with a maximum lift of 90° that each seats two passengers which are restrained by over the shoulder restraints. The Moser version also moves in a counterclockwise (anticlockwise) rotation, where the HUSS Swing Around rotates in a clockwise rotation.\\nSBF Visa.\\nThe Airborne Shot operates very similarly to the HUSS Swing Around.

One of these is located at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom.\\nTechnical Park.\\nTechnical Park markets their Swing Around ride as Apollo 2000. It features 14 three-passenger cars, which is very similar to the Huss Swing Around, except the Huss Swing Around has cars that only seat two passengers. The cars on Technical Park's Apollo 2000 can swing to a height up to 23 feet (7 meters). The ride also rotates clockwise like the Huss Swing Around. The only noticeable difference apart from the three-passenger cars is the style of the restraint, which is an overhead lap bar, used to restrain the passengers throughout the duration of the ride.\\nUnknown Manufacturers.\\nThere are many rides that appear to be similar to the Huss Swing Around which currently have unknown manufacturers. These rides operate in the manner of a Swing Around except they possess features, which make them different than the Huss Swing Around such as restraint styles, car shapes, and the amount of arms on the ride.

He was closely associated with the Glasite church which he helped to promote.\\nHis importance was such that Glasite churches outside Scotland were known as Sandemanian.\\nBiography.\\nEarly life and religious development.\\nHe was born the second of twelve children to a linen weaver, David Sandeman and his wife Margaret Ramsay. He attended Edinburgh University over a two-year period beginning in 1734, where he initially seemed destined for a career in either medicine or the established church. It was here, however, where he encountered the teachings of John Glas, and joined his Dundee congregation in 1735. It was during this period that he apprenticed as a linen weaver for a number of years before starting a family business with his brother William. In 1737 he married Glas\\' daughter Catherine. They did not have any children by the time of her death in 1746. At the age of 26 he was selected as an elder of the Glasite church in Perth.\\nFollowing his wife\\'s death, Sandeman devoted his life to his church and scripture. He traveled between Perth, Dundee, and Edinburgh where he served as elder among these Glasite congregations. He was more forceful than Glas and also more controversial. It was he who was largely responsible for spreading the church\\'s doctrines both within Scotland and elsewhere. As a result of this, outside Scotland the Glasite denomination was known as Sandemanian, reflecting his importance.\\nGrowing influence.\\nIn 1757 he came to wider attention by publishing \"Letters on Theron and Aspasio\", in which he attacked the theology of James Hervey (whose \"Theron and Aspasio\" had been published in 1755.) In particular Sandeman disagreed with Hervey\\'s idea of imputed righteousness but also put forward the intellectualist perception of religion he shared with Glas and his view that faith was the beginning of a correspondence, leading to full assurance of hope.\\nHis work was widely read, and influenced a great many independent clergy throughout England. Because of his easy-believism, the \"Letters\" drew heated responses from theologians such as John Wesley and John Brine who were more closely aligned with Hervey\\'s views. In the years that followed, Samuel Pike, William Cudworth (1717-1763?), John Barnard (1725-1804? Islington), and Benjamin Ingham, all entered into correspondence with him to help them in their ministries. The first three confessed their faith and were admitted into the London congregation, while the latter reorganized his Inghamite churches along the lines set out by Glasites. Ingham was elected elder in his Tadcaster congregation in 1762. John Barnard\\'s correspondence led to Sandeman\\'s London visit and the establishment of the first \"Glasite\", or outside Scotland, \"Sandemanian\" congregation in London at Glover\\'s Hall, Beech Lane, Barbican, 23 March 1762. Cudworth, Barnard, and James Allen, a convert from Ingham, were instrumental to Sandeman and Glas in the establishment of Sandemanian congregations throughout England and Wales.\\nChurch planting in America.\\nSandeman founded one of the first Churches of Christ in America in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on May 4, 1765. In 1760, \"Letters\" was published in New England which led to a 1763 invitation to Danbury, Connecticut to advise on church formation. James Cargill (a glover from Dundee, Scotland) sailed with him aboard the \"George and James\" to Boston. Sandeman engaged in some fairly successful discussions while there, founding some churches despite the opposition of orthodox congregationalists. Around this same time, Sandeman\\'s friend, Ebenezer White established a Church of Christ in Danbury, Connecticut. These efforts resulted in approximately eight congregations being planted in New England and one other in Canada. The congregations emphasized a reliance on Scriptures to find church doctrine, weekly communion, biblical church names such as \"Church of Christ,\" the oversight of elders and congregational autonomy. The congregations associated with Sandeman had trouble being sustained, likely because of his loyalty to Britain in the years leading up to the American War of Independence. However, similar church efforts in New England would be revived around the turn of the century, although independently of Sandeman\\'s influence, by others such as Abner Jones and Elias Smith.\\nFamily.\\nHis father, David Sandeman, was a City Magistrate in Perth from 1735 to 1763.\\nWilliam Sandeman, his brother, developed linen bleachfields in Perthshire.'),\n ('8036703',\n  'Steven Heine',\n  'Steven Heine (born 1950), is a scholar in the field of Zen Buddhist history and thought, particularly the life and teachings of Zen Master Dōgen (1200–1253).

(The oldest blockhouse in North America is Fort Edward). It was part of a garrison built by the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1754-1756 at the outset of the French and Indian War. On July 25, 1754, Major General John Winslow arrived with a force of 600 soldiers to establish the fort at the confluence of the Kennebec River with the Sebasticook River. (William Shirley was also on this expedition.) The palisaded defense was intended to prevent Canadiens and their Native American allies from using the Kennebec River valley as a route to attack English settlements.

The fort was named for George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, the British colonial secretary. A settlement subsequently sprang up under its protection, and was named in honor of Major-General John Winslow, of Marshfield, Massachusetts who had overseen the fort's construction.\\nThe Natives raided the fort in the fall of 1754.\\nIn 1755, the commanding officer, Captain William Lithgow, discontinued Major-General Winslow's original plan for the fort, citing limited manpower and expense.

Human cytogenetics began in 1956 when it was discovered that normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes. However, the first microscopic observations of chromosomes were reported by Arnold, Flemming, and Hansemann in the late 1800s. Their work was ignored for decades until the actual chromosome number in humans was discovered as 46. In 1879, Arnold examined sarcoma and carcinoma cells having very large nuclei. Today, the study of molecular cytogenetics can be useful in diagnosing and treating various malignancies such as hematological malignancies, brain tumors, and other precursors of cancer. The field is overall focused on studying the evolution of chromosomes, more specifically the number, structure, function, and origin of chromosome abnormalities. It includes a series of techniques referred to as fluorescence \"in situ\" hybridization, or FISH, in which DNA probes are labeled with different colored fluorescent tags to visualize one or more specific regions of the genome. Introduced in the 1980s, FISH uses probes with complementary base sequences to locate the presence or absence of the specific DNA regions you are looking for. FISH can either be performed as a direct approach to metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei. Alternatively, an indirect approach can be taken in which the entire genome can be assessed for copy number changes using virtual karyotyping. Virtual karyotypes are generated from arrays made of thousands to millions of probes, and computational tools are used to recreate the genome \"in silico\".\\nCommon techniques.\\nFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\\nFluorescence In Situ Hybridization maps out single copy or repetitive DNA sequences through localization labeling of specific nucleic acids. The technique utilizes different DNA probes labeled with fluorescent tags that bind to one or more specific regions of the genome. It labels all individual chromosomes at every stage of cell division to display structural and numerical abnormalities that may arise throughout the cycle. This is done with a probe that can be locus specific, centromeric, telomeric, and whole-chromosomal. This technique is typically performed on interphase cells and paraffin block tissues. FISH maps out single copy or repetitive DNA sequences through localization labeling of specific nucleic acids. The technique utilizes different DNA probes labeled with fluorescent tags that bind to one or more specific regions of the genome. Signals from the fluorescent tags can be seen with microscopy, and mutations can be seen by comparing these signals to healthy cells. For this to work, DNA must be denatured using heat or chemicals to break the hydrogen bonds; this allows hybridization to occur once two samples are mixed. The fluorescent probes create new hydrogen bonds, thus repairing DNA with their complementary bases, which can be detected through microscopy. FISH allows one to visualize different parts of the chromosome at different stages of the cell cycle. FISH can either be performed as a direct approach to metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei. Alternatively, an indirect approach can be taken in which the entire genome can be assessed for copy number changes using virtual karyotyping. Virtual karyotypes are generated from microarrays made of thousands to millions of probes, and computational tools are used to recreate the genome \"in silico\".\\nComparative genomic hybridization (CGH).\\nComparative genomic hybridization (CGH), derived from FISH, is used to compare variations in copy number between a biological sample and a reference. CGH was originally developed to observe chromosomal aberrations in tumour cells. This method uses two genomes, a sample and a control, which are labeled fluorescently to distinguish them. In CGH, DNA is isolated from a tumour sample and biotin is attached. Another labelling protein, digoxigenin, is attached to the reference DNA sample. The labelled DNA samples are co-hybridized to probes during cell division, which is the most informative time for observing copy number variation. CGH uses creates a map that shows the relative abundance of DNA and chromosome number. By comparing the fluorescence in a sample compared to a reference, CGH can point to gains or losses of chromosomal regions. CGH differs from FISH because it does not require a specific target or previous knowledge of the genetic region being analyzed. CGH can also scan an entire genome relatively quickly for various chromosome imbalances, and this is helpful in patients with underlying genetic issues and when an official diagnosis is not known. This often occurs with hematological cancers.\\nArray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).\\nArray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) allows CGH to be performed without cell culture and isolation. Instead, it is performed on glass slides containing small DNA fragments. Removing the cell culture and isolation step dramatically simplifies and expedites the process. Using similar principles to CGH, the sample DNA is isolated and fluorescently labelled, then co-hybridized to single stranded probes to generate signals. Thousands of these signals can be detected for at once, and this process is referred to as parallel screening. Fluorescence ratios between the sample and reference signals are measured, representing the average difference between the amount of each. This will show if there is more or less sample DNA than is expected by reference. \\nApplications.\\nFISH chromosome in-situ hybridization allows the study cytogenetics in pre- and postnatal samples and is also widely used in cytogenetic testing for cancer. While cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes and their structure, cytogenetic testing involves the analysis of cells in the blood, tissue, bone marrow, or fluid to identify changes in chromosomes of an individual. This was often done through karyotyping, and is now done with FISH. This method is commonly used to detect chromosomal deletions or translocations often associated with cancer. FISH is also used for melanocytic lesions, distinguishing atypical melanocytic or malignant melanoma. \\nCancer cells often accumulate complex chromosomal structural changes such as loss, duplication, inversion or movement of a segment. When using FISH, any changes to a chromosome will be made visible through discrepancies between fluorescent-labelled cancer chromosomes and healthy chromosomes. The findings of these cytogenetic experiments can shed light on the genetic causes for the cancer and can locate potential therapeutic targets.\\nMolecular cytogenetics can also be used as a diagnostic tool for congenital syndromes in which the underlying genetic causes of the disease are unknown. Analysis of a patient\\'s chromosome structure can reveal causative changes. New molecular biology methods developed in the past two decades such as next generation sequencing and RNA-seq have largely replaced molecular cytogenetics in diagnostics, but recently the use of derivatives of FISH such as multicolour FISH and multicolour banding (mBAND) has been growing in medical applications.\\nCancer projects.\\nOne of the current projects involving Molecular Cytogenetics involves genomic research on rare cancers, called the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI). The CGCI is a group interested in describing the genetic abnormalities of some rare cancers, by employing advanced sequencing of genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, which may ultimately play a role in cancer pathogenesis. Currently, the CGCI has elucidated some previously undetermined genetic alterations in medulloblastoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The next steps for the CGCI is to identify genomic alternations in HIV+ tumors and in Burkitt\\'s Lymphoma. \\nSome high-throughput sequencing techniques that are used by the CGCI include: whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, ChIP-sequencing, and Illumina Infinum MethylationEPIC BeadCHIP.'),\n ('8036854',\n  'Mikel Dufrenne',\n  'Mikel Dufrenne (9 February 1910, in Clermont, Oise – 10 June 1995, in Paris) was a French philosopher and aesthetician.

He is director of the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve long-term ecological research station. Tilman is also a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara\\'s Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management.\\nEarly life and education.\\nTilman (born Titman) was born in Aurora, Illinois in 1949. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in zoology in 1971 and his PhD in ecology in 1976 at the University of Michigan. Some of his doctoral research was published in the journal \"Science\".\\nCareer and research.\\nIn an August 2001 interview, Tilman states that his passion with ecology stems from his love for both math and biology, and ecology is a field that allows him to express both together along with his love for the outdoors. His work explores how both natural and managed ecosystems can be used to meet the needs of humans, whether it be for food, energy, or ecosystem services. Tilman has performed several studies to further determine the usefulness of grasslands for utilization in biofuel.\\nResource competition.\\nTilman is best known for his work on the role of resource competition in community structure and on the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. One of his most cited articles is the 1994 \"Nature\" article on the \"Biodiversity and stability in grasslands\" which provided data regarding an experiment that began in 1982 with more than 200 plots in a grassland field in the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota. Each of these plots was continuously monitored for 20 years for factors such as species richness and biomass created by the community. Tilman\\'s article looked at data both prior to and following a drought on the grassland plots in 1988, which provided surprising results. The drought provided substantial disturbance and the biomass data showed a strong positive correlation between the plant diversity within the community and the stability of the community as a whole supporting the diversity-stability hypothesis.\\n\"The level to which the soil solution concentration of a limiting resource is reduced by an equilibrial monoculture of a species is called R*. R* is the resource concentration a species requires for it to be able to persist in a habitat. A comparable concept, that of threshold density, exists for host-microparasite inter-actions. The species with the lowest R* for a limiting soil resource is predicted to be the superior competitor for that resource.\"\\nWith regards to succession he focuses on resource ratios, particularly between light and nitrogen. After a big disturbance, the pattern of succession is from high light/low nitrogen towards high nitrogen/low light environment.\\nCompetition and biodiversity.\\nAnother article by Tilman that has received substantial citation is his 1994 \"Ecology\" article that encompasses the idea that large numbers of species can coexist in a small habitat even when they require the same limiting nutrient (such as nitrogen), as long as there is a tradeoff between the species. Basically it means that they can coexist because species that are good competitors are not as good at colonizing or reproducing. In a related paper, Tilman used this model to demonstrate the phenomenon of \"extinction debt,\" which refers to the time delay between habitat destruction and the extinction of species.\\nAwards and honors.\\nIn 2014, he received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category, for scientifically establishing the value of biodiversity, quantifying, for the first time, how it contributes to make ecosystems more productive, more resilient to invasions, and more stable in the face of perturbations such as drought.

It was centred near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected nearby Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (\"Extreme\"). The earthquake was also felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, India and the Xinjiang region. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. Over 86,000 people died, a similar number were injured, and millions were displaced. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in South Asia, surpassing the 1935 Quetta earthquake.\\nEarthquake.\\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable seismicity in the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre about northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\\nIntensity.\\nThe earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of XI (\"Extreme\") evaluated in an area around the epicenter, between the towns of Muzaffarabad and Balakot. It was also assigned XI on the Environmental Seismic Intensity scale. Field surveys of heavy damage to buildings and other structures in Balakot determined that the Modified Mercalli intensity exceeded X. At Muzaffarabad, the intensity peaked VIII–IX (\"Severe–Violent\"). Intensity VII–VIII (\"Very strong–Severe\") was determined in the areas south of Muzaffarabad.\\nThe maximum intensity in India was VIII (\"Destructive\") on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale (MSK), and was felt at Uri. MSK VII was felt in Kupwara and Baramulla. In Srinagar, the earthquake was felt with an MSK intensity of V. At areas where the seismic intensity was lower, collapses were documented.\\nAftershocks.\\nThere were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near Muzaffarabad. As of 27 October 2005 there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 4.0 and above that continued to occur daily. Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the Himalayas are still being formed and growing, and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.\\nDamage.\\nMost of the devastation hit north Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad. Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.\\nThe Pakistani government\\'s official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to the collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.\\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck. Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and because it was the month of Ramadan, most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.\\nAt least 1,350 people were killed and 6,266 injured in Jammu and Kashmir state in India. The tremors were felt as far away as Delhi and Punjab in northern India. Four fatalities and 14 injured survivors were reported in Afghanistan.\\nAccording to Pakistan\\'s Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \"made the appeal to survivors\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief, because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\"\\nIn Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in sector F-10, collapsed and killed many of the residents. Four deaths were reported in Afghanistan, including a young girl who died in Jalalabad, after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in Kabul, but the effects were minimal there.\\nResponse.\\nThe national and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive. In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh Law. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors\\' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.\\nWell over US$5.4 billion (400 billion Pakistani rupees) in aid arrived from all around the world. US Marine and Army helicopters stationed in neighbouring Afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Royal Air Force that were deployed from the United Kingdom. Five crossing points were opened on the Line of Control (LOC), between India and Pakistan, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region, and aid teams from different parts of Pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief.'),\n ('8037104',\n  'Direct-to-consumer advertising',\n  'Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) refers to the marketing and advertising of pharmaceutical products directly to consumers as patients, as opposed to specifically targeting health professionals. The term is synonymous primarily with the advertising of prescription medicines via mass media platforms—most commonly on television and in magazines, but also via online platforms.\\nDirect-to-consumer advertising is only completely legal in New Zealand and the United States, but are subject to regulations regarding the balanced disclosure of a prescription\\'s benefits in comparison to its risks (including but not limited to side effects and contraindications), among other factors. Regulations regarding DTCA are typically applied to advertising materials that describe a prescription\\'s indications and benefits, and may be more lenient to advertising materials which do not discuss uses. Many countries ban any advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers.\\nThere are ethical and regulatory concerns regarding DTCA, specifically the extent to which these ads may unduly influence the prescribing of the prescriptions based on consumer demands when, in some cases, they may not be medically necessary, or there are cheaper options available. Critics of DTCA have argued that too much is spent on marketing medications, rather than into research and development; in the United States, ad spending by drugmakers reached US$5.2 billion in 2016.\\nTypes.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines several common types of DTCA for prescription medication:\\nReminder and help-seeking ads are often used by drugmakers to bypass the more onerous restrictions (such as the required listing of side effects), or outright prohibitions on product claims advertising, as neither of them are focused on promoting the drug itself. Sometimes, a campaign may mix both of these ads, with one ad discussing the condition, and another, similarly-styled ad, mentioning the product but not the condition, seeking to have the viewer infer the association between the ads.\\nLegality.\\nBrazil.\\nIn 2008 a new resolution from ANVISA (Control Agency for Sanitary Vigilance), Resolution 96 from December 17 was released, with focus on medication advertisements. It allows direct-to-consumer advertising of non-prescription medication, with restrictions on the type of drug and words and images that can be used, among other things. Advertisements for prescription medications can only appear in scientific, medical, or health professional journals.\\nCanada.\\nThe Food and Drugs Act prohibits most direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications: all direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs was forbidden until 1978, when Health Canada began to allow ads containing names, quantities, and prices only, so that pharmacies could display their prices for comparison purposes. In 2000, Health Canada adopted an interpretation of this law allowing for the aforementioned \"reminder\" and \"help-seeking\" advertisements, although U.S.-style \"full product ads\" that mention the purpose of a prescription remain prohibited. Later that year, Health Canada ruled that a pairing of similarly-themed reminder and help-seeking commercials ran afoul of the regulations, as their combination constituted a full product ad.\\nThere are no regulations requiring direct-to-consumer marketing prohibited under Canadian law to be removed or substituted from U.S. television channels and print publications distributed in the country.\\nIn 2014, York University professor and physician Dr. Joel Lexchin, and University of British Columbia associate professor Barbara Mintzes, published a study that highlighted 10 DTC cases between 2000 and 2011 with \"unsatisfactory\" responses from Health Canada. They found that Health Canada\\'s application of these regulations \"[lacked] accountability and transparency\"—with no public record of complaints and enforcement besides media coverage of certain prominent cases, and no evidence that Health Canada has ever issued fines for violations. In conclusion, they stated that \"since DTCA became prominent in the U.S. in the mid-1990s, successive governments of different political stripes in Canada have shown a remarkably consistent commitment to non-enforcement\".\\nEurope.\\nIn October 2002, the European Commission voted against a proposal to selectively allow advertising of \"disease education information\" in relation to AIDS, asthma, and diabetes. Despite insistence otherwise due to its selective and controlled nature, the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety assessed that the pharmaceutical industry could not be trusted to provide impartial and unbiased information. UK Labour Party MEP Catherine Stihler argued that the proposal was a \"slippery slope\" towards U.S.-style advertising practices promoting expensive \"wonder drugs\", and that \"we don\\'t want consumers sitting on their couches bombarded with a hard sell from big drug companies in the advertising break between \"Crossroads\" and \"Coronation Street\".\"\\nHong Kong.\\nUnder the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance, advertising of medications is only legal for \"minor\" diseases, such as coughs and colds, headaches, indigestion, and others. Ads may not include depictions of treatment, medical professionals, or dramatizations of symptoms.\\nNew Zealand.\\nUnder the Medicines Act of 1981, and regulated by the Therapeutic Products Advertising Code and a self-regulatory code by the industry group Medicines New Zealand, New Zealand is one of the only countries beside the United States to allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications. An ongoing review of the Act to develop a replacement, the Therapeutic Products Bill, has faced lobbying efforts for and against the continued legality of DTCA.\\nUnited Kingdom.\\nAdvertising materials directed towards the general public are prohibited from containing any references to prescription-only medications, under the basis that they are not be presented as a consumer\\'s choice. The home page of a drug manufacturer\\'s website also constitutes advertising material, and thus may not include references to prescription products either.\\nIn a 2005 Health Select Committee hearing, GlaxoSmithKline UK general manager Eddie Gray stated that the company did not plan to lobby for DTC in the region, citing prevailing consumer attitudes against the concept.\\nUnited States.\\nUnder the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), direct-to-consumer \"product claim\" advertisements for a prescription medication must include information on their major side effects and contraindications in the main body, with a \"fair balance\" in its coverage of benefits to risks. Unless they are given \"adequate provision\" via a variety of different outlets, ads must also include a \"brief summary\" of all risks associated with the medication. In print ads within magazines, this summary is typically given on a second page. \\nPrint ads must contain a standard notice that instructs patients to report negative side effects and adverse events to the FDA\\'s MedWatch program. In ads carried on broadcast media, such as television commercials, only the major side effects are typically listed, and the ad directs viewers to consult a website or current magazine issue for more information (the aforementioned \"brief summary\"). If the drug is subject to a boxed warning from the FDA (which indicates a serious risk), the warning must be reproduced in all advertising materials, and reminder ads for the drug are prohibited. \\nIf an advertisement does not contain health claims, it does not fall under the FDA\\'s jurisdiction, but can still be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.\\nEarly history.\\nIn 1962, the United States Congress gave the FDA the authority to regulate prescription drug labeling and advertising, but the FDA did not establish regulations until 1969. These required that ads for prescriptions include information on their major side effects and contraindications, and unless they have \"adequate provision\" via different outlets, a \"brief summary\" of all side effects and contraindications.\\nPharmaceutical companies shifted the focus of their marketing efforts to licensed medical doctors in the 1970s, as the FDA mandated that only doctors could prescribe medicine. However, a larger movement towards autonomy in health care decisions prompted the first prominent examples of direct-to-consumer advertising. Merck published the first print DTC ad for a pneumonia vaccine (with a particular focus on those aged 65 years or older), and Boots Pharmaceuticals aired the first DTC television commercial in 1983 for the prescription ibuprofen Rufen. The advertisement promoted it as a cheaper alternative to the leading brand Motrin, and did not contain health claims. The FDA briefly demanded that the Rufen ad be pulled, but it was restored after minor amendments.\\nAs its guidelines were not written with mass media in mind, these early campaigns prompted concern from the FDA, especially after the arthritis drug Oraflex (whose release had been backed by a significant PR campaign) was recalled after only five months on the market, following reports of adverse reactions and deaths. FDA commissioner Arthur Hayes showed reservations for the impact that DTCA would have on the industry and public health, and called for a moratorium in September 1983 pending further regulations. The moratorium was lifted in 1985. The industry felt that the requirement for a \"brief summary\" of all side effects was designed with print media in mind, and that their increasing length and technical language (often taking up an entire separate page of fine print when published in a magazine) made television advertising of prescriptions unfeasible. By the 1990s, there were calls for the FDA to loosen its regulations to make the concept viable.\\nPartial deregulation.\\nA 1996 marketing campaign for then-prescription allergy medication Claritin found a loophole, by intentionally excluding information about the medication itself from its advertising. Claritin\\'s television commercial contained only imagery, slogans such as \"Clear days and nights are here\" and \"It\\'s time for Claritin\", and asked viewers to call a phone number or consult their doctor for more information. In 1997, the FDA issued new guidelines that were intended to make DTCM on radio and television less burdensome. In particular, the FDA clarified that informing the audience of where the \"brief summary\" can be obtained (such as a magazine ad, phone hotline, or website) constituted \"adequate provision\" of risk information, and thus relieved them from being included in the ad. The FDA also recognized reminder ads (such as the aforementioned Claritin ad) as not being subject to these rules, since they do not contain claims or statements regarding the indications and benefits of the medication.\\nThe industry quickly took advantage of the new guidelines: by 1998, advertising spending on DTCA had reached $1.12 billion. Despite this growth, there were concerns that some ads had an insufficient focus on properly discussing the product, while concerns were also shown for the advertising of erectile dysfunction medications during programming that may be widely watched by children. In 2005, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) instituted new voluntary guidelines for DTCA, including requirements to voluntarily submit ads to the FDA for review and educate health professionals on new medications before an advertising campaign commences, use clear language in advertising, obtain appropriate age targeting for advertisements involving subject matter that may be inappropriate to certain audiences, and to not use \"reminder\" ads. By 2011, spending on pharmaceutical advertising had grown to approximately US$4.5 billion per year, and increased to $5.2 billion by 2016.\\nWith the increasing spending, DTCA began to face opposition. In 2015, the American Medical Association\\'s house of delegates voted in favor of a motion supporting the prohibition of DTCA, arguing that these marketing efforts contribute to the high cost of drugs, and \"inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate\". On March 4, 2016, Senator Al Franken introduced the Protecting Americans from Drug Marketing Act, which proposed the removal of tax breaks for pharmaceutical companies who engage in DTCA. Franken similarly showed concerns that the industry was spending too much on marketing. In a similar move, representative Rosa DeLauro called for a three-year moratorium on advertising of newly-approved prescription drugs.\\nProposed display of list prices.\\nOn May 8, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approved a mandate for list prices to be displayed in advertising for any prescription that costs $35 or higher for 30 days of treatment. Ads could also include price comparisons against competitors.\\nPhRMA objected to the rule, arguing that prominent display of list prices would cause confusion because they do not reflect what patients would typically pay under insurance coverage (the rule did require display of a disclaimer stating that those with health insurance may pay a different amount). When the rule was proposed in October 2018, PhRMA stated that its members would commit to publishing detailed pricing information online (including possible out-of-pocket costs, and information on financial support options), and directing viewers to this information within their advertising. However, the HHS disputed their arguments, arguing that list prices would help patients calculate how much they would pay, especially if they have not yet met their insurance deductible, or the drug is not covered by their insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar compared the proposed requirement to similar regulations involving list prices for automobiles.\\nOn July 8, 2019, shortly before it was to take effect, the rule was struck down by DC district judge Amit Mehta, who ruled that it overstepped the HHS\\' authority.\\nReception.\\nSupporters of direct-to-consumer advertising argue that advertisements increase competition which leads to lower prescription drug prices and new development, citing, for instance, that between 1997 and 2001, spending on research and development in the U.S. increased 59% while spending on promoting drugs directly to patients increased 145%. However, other experts have asserted that funding for R&amp;D is determined by several other factors. Direct-to-consumer advertising, among other patient education initiatives, can educate consumers and patients about new treatments and therapeutic options that may not have been proactively mentioned by their healthcare professional. Proponents of DTCA claim this provides a vital opportunity for the public to be aware of what is available to them and to engage in an educated discussion with their doctor. A study observed that direct-to-consumer advertising promotes communication between patients and their doctors about medications. Thirty percent of Americans indicated they talk with their doctor about a medicine they saw on TV. In addition, surveys showed that increased advertising has had a positive impact on the degree to which people adhere to a given course of treatment – but only among those who were already on medication prior to exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising. Among this population, a 10% increase in exposure to drug advertising increases the rate of adherence between 1% and 2%.\\nSome studies have asserted that direct-to-consumer advertising misleads patients into demanding heavily-advertised drugs, leading to superfluous or sub-optimal treatment. Doctors may feel pressured to prescribe specific brand-name medications because they were mentioned by a patient. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 47% of all antibiotics prescribed in the United States were unnecessary. Another study of young people living in West Palm Beach, Florida found that a 10% increase in advertising expose increased the total number of prescriptions by 5%; a higher percentage change than in Denver, Colorado – where DTCA expenditures per person are lower.\\nMarket impact.\\nIt has been argued that direct-to-consumer advertising can influence the doctor–patient relationship, including patients bringing up their need for an advertised, name-brand drug as their primary concern during a doctor visit, and becoming interested in newly-introduced medications that may not have undergone sufficient postmarketing surveillance. It has been demonstrated that direct-to-consumer ads have contributed to the frequency of requests made by patients towards their physicians to prescribe analgesic drugs, including opioids. A patient\\'s request for a specific medication dramatically increases the rate at which physicians prescribe usually more expensive, branded drugs even when treatment for existing indications does not warrant such use. Pharmaceutical companies have also faced allegations of \"disease mongering\"—the process of promoting awareness of minor conditions such as balding and skin wrinkles in such a way that it encourages the sale of treatments for them.\\nCritics also argue that resources spent on advertising could otherwise be spent on research and development for new drugs and medical therapies. Danish physician Peter C. Gøtzsche indicated that pharmaceutical companies will advertise for their most profitable products, many of which are unnecessary \"me-too\" drugs. He maintains that \"there is no need for marketing, as the products should speak for themselves.\"\\nDrug safety.\\nAdvertisements generally begin within a year of drugs entering the market, before postmarketing surveillance is available to see if adverse effects emerge, which increases the risk of harm. In the early 2000s, the FDA\\'s resources to screen DTC ads were not keeping pace with the number of ads being produced, raising the risk that the inappropriate ads were not removed. Vioxx was heavily marketed and was widely-prescribed after its approval in 1999. When the drug was withdrawn for safety reasons in 2004, Merck, its developer, and the FDA were criticized for the campaign.\\nSeveral DTC ads have faced criticism or FDA warnings over containing depictions of activities that are part of a prescription\\'s contraindications, such as an advertisement for the blood thinner Xarelto which featured scenes of a patient spokesperson among motorcycles (despite a disclaimer stating that the spokespatient had to stop riding her motorcycle whilst taking the medication), and a print ad for the Factor IX treatment Idelvion containing an image of a soccer player (with the FDA warning that soccer was a \"moderate to dangerous high-risk activity for hemophilic patients\", and that the ad falsely implied patients could engage in such activity without consequences).\\nGender stereotypes.\\nSome drug ads have \"gendered\" diseases in ways that do not reflect actual epidemiology. Women\\'s bodies have also been objectified to mask or distract from unpleasant aspects of diseases. The marketing of drugs for inflammatory bowel disease have been called out on both counts. Similarly, the marketing of Gardasil was primarily aimed at young women, when sexually transmitted diseases are carried by, and affect, both genders.'),\n ('8037111', 'Blaze of Glory', 'As a title, Blaze of Glory may refer to:'),\n ('8037126',\n  'Antonio Caballero y Góngora',\n  'Antonio Caballero y Góngora (in full, \"Antonio Pascual de San Pedro de Alcántara Caballero y Góngora\") (24 May 1723 in Priego de Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain – 24 March 1796 in Córdoba) was a Spanish Roman Catholic prelate in the colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada, and from 1782 to 1789 the viceroy of New Granada (present day Colombia and Ecuador).\\nIn Spain and New Spain.\\nAntonio Caballero was born into a hidalgo family in Córdoba. His parents were Juan Caballero y Espinar and Antonia de Góngora. He studied first in Córdoba. At the age of 15 he received a scholarship to study theology in the Colegio de San Bartolomé y Santiago in Granada. He continued his studies at the Colegio Imperial de Santa Catalina, graduating in 1744. He was ordained a priest on 19 September 1750. About this time he wrote a biography of the Granadan poet José Antonio Porcel y Salablanca.\\nIn 1753 he was named canon of the cathedral of Córdoba, where he remained until 1775. He was a cultured man and a lover of the arts. He collected paintings by Velázquez, Rubens, Titian, etc., and his library contained the most modern works on all branches of knowledge. He was also a numismatist.\\nHe was named bishop of Mérida in Yucatán in 1775, in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (colonial México). Sailing to Cuba in the spring of 1776 for his consecration, he was accompanied by much of his family and friends, including his nephew Manuel Torres. He brought with him 38 crates of books, rich ornaments, paintings, and coins. He reorganized the Colegio de San Pedro, which had fallen on hard times since the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767.\\nArchbishop of Bogotá.\\nIn 1777 he was named archbishop of Santa Fé de Bogotá in the colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada by King Charles III, and confirmed by the pope. He arrived there on 5 March 1778. There he worked assiduously and successfully to pacify the rebels of the Comunero Revolt. For his services, King Charles subsequently made him a member of the Order of Carlos III and viceroy of New Granada.\\nHe did much important pastoral work. He reformed the system of tithes and founded the sees of Mérida (Venezuela) and Cuenca (Quito). He was unsuccessful in founding a see at Antioquia and in placing the diocese of Panama under the jurisdiction of Bogotá (instead of Lima). Neither was he able to organize a provincial council of New Granada, as he had hoped.\\nRevolt of the Comuneros.\\nIn 1780 the Revolt of the Comuneros broke out in the Viceroyalty of New Granada, almost at the same time as the revolt of Túpac Amaru in Viceroyalty of Perú. This was largely a reaction against the new system of taxes ordered by Charles III. To institute these reforms, the Crown sent Juan Francisco Gutiérrez de Piñeres to the colony in 1777, with the title of \"visitador\" (inspector). He established a tobacco monopoly, prohibiting its cultivation in certain regions, such as Socorro and Chiriquí Province. He set taxes on playing cards and aguardiente, organized the tax office, and set up customs offices in Cartagena and Bogotá.\\nThe revolt began in Simacota, and included Mestizos, Criollos and Indigenous. About 20,000 men marched on the capital to demand the repeal of the new taxes, defeating colonial troops along the way. Viceroy Manuel Antonio Flórez had left the capital for Cartagena to defend against an expected attack there by the British. Visitador Gutiérrez de Piñeres was forced to flee before the Comuneros. The \"Audiencia\" and the archbishop formed a delegation to meet with the rebels. The meeting was held at Zipaquirá, only 60\\xa0km from the capital.\\nThe rebels demanded the elimination of the new taxes and reductions in the old ones. Archbishop Caballero convinced the members of the Audiencia to accept all the terms. An agreement was reached on 7 June 1781, and the archbishop swore on the gospels to uphold it. The rebels dispersed. Nevertheless, once back in Bogotá the Audiencia and the archbishop repudiated the agreement. The Comuneros rose again, but with less success. They were violently suppressed, and their leaders captured and executed.\\nViceroy of New Granada.\\nViceroy Manuel Antonio Flórez resigned on 26 November 1781 and was replaced by Juan de Torrezar Díaz Pimienta, governor of Cartagena. However Torrezar died on 11 June 1782, only four days after arriving in the capital. A sealed letter opened after his death directed that the new interim Viceroy of New Granada should be Archbishop Caballero y Góngora.\\nIt thus fell to Caballero to pacify the viceroyalty. He promulgated a pardon granted by the king, expanded and improved the colonial army, and sent Franciscan missionaries to the affected provinces to preach peace and obedience to the king. He also requested the Crown to abolish the recent reforms, including the creation of \"intendencias\" in the colony. New Granada become the only Spanish territory in the Americas where they were not established.\\nHis efforts to modernize the viceroyalty were of great importance. He stimulated the economy, industry and the arts, and greatly assisted the Royal Botanical Expedition of 1783, under José Celestino Mutis. In 1782 and 1783 he had to deal with an epidemic of smallpox. In 1783 the interim character of his appointment was removed, and he became viceroy in his own right. In October 1784 he went to Cartagena to settle the Indian population in towns, and to suppress an Indigenous rebellion in Darién and promote colonization there. The latter project was not successful. He founded new missions in Casanare and San Martín.\\nIn 1787 he asked to be relieved of his positions, and the king granted his request the following year.\\nIn 1788 he was appointed bishop of Córdoba. He sailed for Spain in April 1789.

Raised by his grandmother after being orphaned at age 12, he joined the United States Marine Corps in 1947. After his discharge, he played baseball for the New York Yankees\\' Triple-A club in 1950, but he was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. After his second discharge, he joined the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in 1955.\\nHis career with the NYPD spanned 15 years, and he was reported to have been responsible for more than 8,000 arrests. Among his exploits, Egan (along with his partner Sonny Grosso and other NYPD detectives) broke up an organized crime ring in 1961, seizing 112 pounds of heroin, a record amount at the time. The investigation was chronicled in a 1969 book, \"The French Connection\", by Robin Moore.\\nThe book was adapted to a motion picture of the same name, released in 1971. The movie was highly fictionalized and very successful. The character based on Egan, Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle, was played by Gene Hackman who won an Academy Award for his performance (the film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Editing). The character was called \"Popeye\" because that was Egan\\'s nickname in real life. Egan played a role in the movie as Hackman\\'s supervisor, Simonson. Egan and Grosso were also technical advisors. Hackman reprised this role in the sequel film \"French Connection II\" in 1975, which depicts a fictionalized story.\\nSoon after the film was released, Egan asked to retire from the NYPD. On his retirement day in November 1971, he was fired for failing to make court appearances in conjunction with his cases and for failing to turn in contraband weapons and narcotics, losing him his pension benefits. He won an appeal and his pension was reinstated.\\nIn 1973 another film, called \"Badge 373\", with Robert Duvall playing the role of Egan, was released detailing Egan\\'s career. Egan played Lt. Scanlon in the movie, once again (like in \"The French Connection\") as an authority figure more or less sympathetic to the protagonist whose personality is based on himself. Also in 1973, ABC ordered and aired a television pilot entitled \"Egan\", this time with Eugene Roche playing Egan, a tough NYPD cop transferred to Los Angeles, but it failed to go to series. In 1986, Fox developed \"Popeye Doyle\", a proposed series based on the fictionalized character from the two films rather than Egan himself, with Ed O\\'Neill playing the title character. While the series was never produced, the pilot was broadcast as an NBC-TV Movie, and has been shown in syndication.\\nAfter retiring from the NYPD, Egan became a full-time actor, usually playing law enforcement figures. He portrayed the head of the NYPD\\'s Son of Sam task force in the 1985 movie \"Out of the Darkness\", and throughout his career he played roles in more than 20 movies and television series.

Lanier was appointed by Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty in January 2007, replacing outgoing Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey. She is the first woman to hold the position. In May 2012, Mayor Vincent C. Gray agreed to retain Lanier as police chief under a new five-year contract. Lanier accepted a third appointment from Mayor Muriel Bowser in 2016, making her the first Chief of Police in MPD history to serve three Mayors. Violent crime dropped 23 percent over the years Lanier was chief, and homicides plunged to a half-century low in 2012. On August 16, 2016, it was announced that Lanier had accepted a position as the Senior Vice President of Security with the National Football League. Her last day as Police Chief was September 15, 2016, when she was succeeded by her deputy, Peter Newsham. Lanier was the longest serving Chief of Police in the history of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia.\\nEarly life and education.\\nLanier was raised in suburban Tuxedo, Maryland, on the northeast edge of the District of Columbia in Prince George\\'s County, Maryland.\\nLanier dropped out of high school after the ninth grade, and became a mother at the age of 15. Lanier rose from a challenging childhood. She later earned a GED and Associate’s degree at the University of the District of Columbia.\\nShe has both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in management from Johns Hopkins University and holds a Master of Arts in national security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California; her thesis was \"Preventing Terror Attacks in the Homeland: A New Mission for State and Local Police.\" She attended an executive education program at Harvard Kennedy School. \\nCareer.\\nLanier joined the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia in 1990 as a foot patrolman. In 1994, she was promoted to Sergeant and, two years later, a Lieutenant, before becoming a patrol supervisor. In 1999, she became a Captain and, later that year, was promoted to Inspector and placed in charge of the Department\\'s Major Narcotics Branch/Gang Crime Unit. In August 2000, she was promoted to Commander-in-Charge of the Fourth District of the city. In April 2006, she became the Commander at the Office of Homeland Security and Counter-terrorism, Office of the Chief of Police in MPDC, overseeing, among other things, the bomb squad and the emergency response team.\\nLanier was criticized in July 2009 after claiming that motorists who used GPS navigation and smartphones to avoid traffic cameras were employing a \"cowardly tactic\".\\nLanier has defended the practice of arresting individuals reselling tickets to sporting events, even if the tickets were sold at face value. The tactic has led to the arrest of out of town visitors who had extra tickets to see the Washington Nationals.\\nShe retired from the Metropolitan Police Department in September 2016 to become the head of security of the National Football League.'}},\n  {'_index': 'wiki_evidence',\n   '_id': 'PVbCwYIBMr6oNIdkfPmn',\n   '_score': 7.3120947,\n   '_ignored': ['text.keyword'],\n   '_source': {'id': '8033421',\n    'title': 'Chinese Softball Association',\n    'text': 'The Chinese Softball Association is a non-government, non-profit organization, headquartered in Beijing.

For this musical work, Verdi utilized the national anthems of several European nations.\\nProduction.\\nIn December 1943, Arturo Toscanini filmed a performance of this music for inclusion in an Office of War Information documentary about the role of Italian-Americans in aiding the Allies during World War II. Toscanini added a bridge passage to include arrangements of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the United States and \"The Internationale\" for the Soviet Union and the Italian partisans. Joining Toscanini in the filmed performance in NBC Studio 8-H, were tenor Jan Peerce, the Westminster Choir, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra.\\nThe film also included the overture to Verdi\\'s opera \"La Forza del Destino\". The narration was written by May Sarton, film editing by Boris Kaufman, and narration read by actor Burgess Meredith. The original version was released on VHS by Blackhawk Films, which retitled it \"Arturo Toscanini Conducts Giuseppe Verdi\". A newly restored version by the Library of Congress, with the Meredith narration, has been issued on DVD.\\nReception.\\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The Academy Film Archive preserved \"Hymn of the Nations\" in 2010. The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives.\\nCensorship.\\nDuring the post-war Red Scare, the US government crudely censored \"The Internationale\" out of the film. The version continued to be released without any acknowledgement of censorship.
