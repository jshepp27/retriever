       "['I cant remember the topic that spurred this discussion but a friend and I were debating whether manmade things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. He cited this definition by MerriamWebster existing in nature and not made or caused by people coming from nature as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.However I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankinds capacity to create problemsolve analyze rationalize and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature thus how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature I would understand the distinction between natural and manmade. However I think unnatural and manmade are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that manmade things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.',\n",

I cant help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible. All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they dont make actual healing claims Im told this is because they arent FDA approved and could get in trouble. Ive looked a little and havent found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS. I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this.

       " 'Thinking about todays news BBC WikipediaI think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an antiislam and antiimmigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many who are afraid more then anything to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists which might have been the goal of the attack anyway. I think this regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if out of people carried a gun with them was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse and society upheld the value of these people as protectors it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the not one of us pack mentality and escalation of police state.Change my view.PS I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.',\n",
       " 'Ive been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an oversimplification of the view but Ill elaborate more here. Technically its a twopart view Explaining causation is not blaming the victim. Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.Id be happy to have either view changed though if view is changed Id probably change my mind on view . Itll be easier to change my mind in other words about view than view Im not certain that its a worthwhile endeavor.Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. Theres an unfortunate tendency that Ive noticed particularly on the Internet but occasionally in person as well to blame the victims of terrible situations. Were seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens people trying to find a reason why the person was shot and we see it with victims of rape people say you shouldnt have been so drunk or you shouldnt have been in that area of town. There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who dont deserve it. We like to think of our world as just in some way so we come up with reasons why these people Deserved what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman deserved to be raped but theres a certain amount of otherization and lack of empathy that goes on a sense that well that wouldnt have happened to me because I wouldve been more careful. Additionally it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And thats all bad.On the other hand it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes we can work towards justice we can work towards eliminating racism overt or structural and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime however it is important to understand lines of causation. Im not going with a very complicated definition of causation here basically a model in which two events or situations occur A and B and one event B would not have occurred the other A had not occurred. A caused B. Im aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model but thats not the view Im trying to have changed if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points go ahead.The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe for the most part but there are certain areas that you shouldnt walk in at night because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is if we hadnt been walking through those areas we wouldnt have gotten mugged. So we dont walk through those areas at night anymore. Its still possible that well get mugged elsewhere but in my mind weve decreased our chances which is a good thing. We didnt deserve to get mugged before but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.Thus explaining causation is not justification. Its simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.Finally my second view is that its a worthwhile endeavor. As I said we avoid those dangerous areas at night now and I feel weve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally all areas would be safe to walk in but theyre not so we dont walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes this has mildly restricted our behavior but its worth it to us so that we dont get mugged. I understood these are hairy issues and maybe theres a fine line between causation and justification. .As far as part of my view goes I still stand by my original statement. Granted people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term causation but as I said Im not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that its very complex and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of eventsoutcomes my point was never to say that avoid certain areas means you wont get mugged or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk a change in probability. Furthermore the point itself was actually that explaining causation is not victim blaming and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. Ive changed my view to the point that I dont think explaining causation is always the appropriate response particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault. I do still think its often important to explain causation before the fact as some users have suggested as an alternative simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said theyre the same thing but not really offered an explanation for that. At any rate Ive enjoyed reading the responses so far Im aware this is a sensitive issue and Im glad discussions have remained pretty civil.',\n",
