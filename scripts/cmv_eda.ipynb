Were on the same page there. To expand on that we face a lot of practical questions about what things have value. When we create school curricula were making value judgments when we allot budgets. These are at least in one facet philosophical questions and important ones.But you suggest we can answer these questions without studying philosophy. Can we answer high level economic questions without studying economics and math? Can we figure out plumbing questions without training in plumbing?These value decisions and value is just one kind of philosophical question we deal with constantly can be based on valid or invalid arguments. If no one studies arguments of value why do you believe that we can naturally recognize these with no study? Why do you think we should start from scratch in all value decisions rather than seeking to understand the work that has been done in the past?A lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because its been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that were currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here and failing to challenge some of our current baseline.Not everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not. If no one studies it then no one will be able to teach it. If no one is able to teach it then everyones philosophical positions will have no rigor will make no use of the work that has already been done before.All our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by rshowerthoughts or rtrees. Without rigor and background thats where introspection gets you."
